\section{Threat Analysis}\label{sec:Threat_Analysis}
To perform any kind of threat analysis, the system's specification must be considered.
The state of the system (new or existing) must also be considered.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item The specification of the system to be analyzed
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item If a completely new system is about to be built, there might not even exist a system specification and it needs to be created.
  \item If the analysis is to done on an existing system, the first task is to read existing system specifications, source code and/or make interviews with people familiar with the system.
  \end{itemize}

\item The specification must not necessarily be very detailed but can be a high-level description of the system.
\end{itemize}

  An \emph{attack goal} is a technology, process, or thing that an attacker would like to gain access to.
  These are the things we are trying to protect against or mitigate.
