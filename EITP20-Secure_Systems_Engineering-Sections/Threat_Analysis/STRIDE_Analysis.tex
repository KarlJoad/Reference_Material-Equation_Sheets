\begin{definition}[STRIDE Analysis]\label{def:STRIDE_Analysis}
  \emph{STRIDE} is an acronym standing for
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item [S] Spoofing
  \item [T] Tampering
  \item [R] Repudiation
  \item [I] Information Disclosure
  \item [D] Denial of Service
  \item [E] Elevation of Privilege
  \end{itemize}

  It is a model to identify computer security threats in software systems or components of a larger software system.
  It is general enough to analyze any part of a software system.

  To perform a STRIDE analysis, it is commonly applied with these steps:
  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item Identify the main entities in the system
  \item Identify the interactions between/among the main entities.
  \item For each entity, perform a STRIDE analysis on the following actions:
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Processes
    \item External Entities
    \item Data Flows
    \item Data Stores
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{remark}[Incomplete Methodology]\label{rmk:STRIDE_Incomplete_Methodology}
    Like \nameref{def:Attack_Tree}s, \nameref{def:STRIDE_Analysis} is not a complete methodology.
    It only helps identify typical attacks, but is not a ``complete package''.

    Spoofing & Authentication & Pretending to be something or someone other than yourself & Processes, External Entities, People & Falsely claiming to be a police officer. \\ \midrule
    Tampering & Integrity & Modifying something on disk, on a network, or in memory & Data stores, data flows, processes & Changing spreadsheet, binary contents, database contents, modifying network packets, or the program running. \\ \midrule
    Repudiation & Non-Repudiation & Claiming that you didn't do something or were not responsible. & Process & Process: ``I didn't hit the big red button''. \\ \midrule
    Information Disclosure & Confidentiality & Providing information to someone not authorized to see it & Processes, data stores, data flows & Allow access to file contents/file metadata, network packets, contents of program memory. \\ \midrule
    Denial of Service & Availability & Deliberately absorbing more resources than needed to provide a service & Processes, data stores, data flows & Program uses all available memory, File fills up disk, too many network connections for real traffic. \\ \midrule
    Elevation of Privilege & Authorization & Allowing someone to do something they're not authorized to do. & Process & Allow normal user to execute code as administrator. Remote person can run code. \\
