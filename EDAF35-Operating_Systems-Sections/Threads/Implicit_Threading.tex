\subsection{Implicit Threading}\label{subsec:Implicit_Threading}
Because programs are starting to use so many \nameref{def:Thread}s that it is becoming hard to manage, the creation and management of threads is moving from developers to compilers/run-time libaries.
This way, the computer manages threads rather than the programmer.

\begin{definition}[Implicit Threading]\label{def:Implicit_Threading}
  \emph{Implicit Threading} is the transfer of \nameref{def:Thread} creation and management away from the programmer, and to the compiler and/or run-time libaries.
  This frees the programmer from having to think/worry about the issues that arise because of multithreading, while still allowing programs to take advantage of the benefits of multithreading.
