\subsection{User and Kernel Threads}\label{subsec:User_Kernel_Threads}
A relationship must exist between \nameref{def:User_Thread}s and \nameref{def:Kernel_Thread}s.
There are three common ways of establishing such a relationship:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item The \nameref{subsubsec:Many_To_One_Model}
\item The \nameref{subsubsec:One_To_One_Model}
\item The \nameref{subsubsec:Many_To_Many_Model}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{definition}[User Thread]\label{def:User_Thread}
  \emph{User thread}s are \nameref{def:Thread}s created by a \nameref{def:User} \nameref{def:Process}.
  They are supported above the kernel and are managed without kernel support.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Kernel Thread]\label{def:Kernel_Thread}
  \emph{Kernel thread}s are \nameref{def:Thread}s created by the \nameref{def:Kernel}.
  They are supported and managed directly by the operating system.
\end{definition}
