\subsection{Thread Libraries}\label{subsec:Thread_Libraries}
\begin{definition}[Thread Library]\label{def:Thread_Library}
  A \emph{thread library} is an \nameref{def:API} that allows a programmer to create and manage \nameref{def:Thread}s.
\end{definition}

There are 2 main ways to implement a \nameref{def:Thread_Library}:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item Provide a library entirely in user space with no kernel support.
  All code and data structures for the library exist in \textbf{user-space}.
  This means that invoking a library function results in a function call in user space and not a system call.
\item Implement a kernel-level library supported directly by the operating system.
  All code and data structures for the library exist in \textbf{kernel-space}.
  Invoking a library function results in a \nameref{def:System_Call} to the \nameref{def:Kernel}.
\end{enumerate}

There are 3 different libraries that are used frequently.
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item POSIX Pthreads.
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item This provides a standard interface for \textbf{how the threads should behave}.
  \item The actual implementation details are left for the implementor to decide.
  \item Global variables are shared between threads.
  \item Brought in by the standard library's \kernelinline{pthread.h} header.
  \end{itemize}
\item Windows' Threads.
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Global variables are shared between threads.
  \item Must include the \kernelinline{windows.h} header.
  \end{itemize}
\item Java's Threads.
\end{enumerate}
