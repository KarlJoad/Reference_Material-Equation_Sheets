\subsection{Thread Libraries}\label{subsec:Thread_Libraries}
\begin{definition}[Thread Library]\label{def:Thread_Library}
  A \emph{thread library} is an \nameref{def:API} that allows a programmer to create and manage \nameref{def:Thread}s.
\end{definition}

There are 2 main ways to implement a \nameref{def:Thread_Library}:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item Provide a library entirely in user space with no kernel support.
  All code and data structures for the library exist in \textbf{user-space}.
  This means that invoking a library function results in a function call in user space and not a system call.
\item Implement a kernel-level library supported directly by the operating system.
  All code and data structures for the library exist in \textbf{kernel-space}.
  Invoking a library function results in a \nameref{def:System_Call} to the \nameref{def:Kernel}.
\end{enumerate}
