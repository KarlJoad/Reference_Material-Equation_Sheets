\subsection{File Allocation Methods}\label{subsec:File_Allocation_Methods}
The direct-access nature of disks gives us flexibility in the implementation of files.
In almost every case, many files are stored on the same disk.
The main problem is how to allocate space to these files so that disk space is utilized effectively while allowing for quick access to files.

\subsubsection{Contiguous File Allocation}\label{subsubsec:Contiguous_File_Allocation}
Contiguous allocation requires that each file occupy a set of contiguous blocks on the disk.
Disk addresses define a linear ordering on the disk.
