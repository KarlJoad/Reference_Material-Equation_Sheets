\subsection{File Allocation Methods}\label{subsec:File_Allocation_Methods}
The direct-access nature of disks gives us flexibility in the implementation of files.
In almost every case, many files are stored on the same disk.
The main problem is how to allocate space to these files so that disk space is utilized effectively while allowing for quick access to files.

\subsubsection{Contiguous File Allocation}\label{subsubsec:Contiguous_File_Allocation}
Contiguous allocation requires that each file occupy a set of contiguous blocks on the disk.
Disk addresses define a linear ordering on the disk.

Contiguous allocation of a file is defined by the disk address of the first block and length (in blocks).
If the file is $n$ blocks long and starts at location $b$, then it occupies blocks $b, b+1, \ldots, b+n-1$.
The directory entry for each file indicates the address of the starting block and the length of the area allocated for this file.

\paragraph{Advantages of Contiguous Allocation}\label{par:Contiguous_File_Allocation_Advantages}
Accessing a file that has been allocated contiguously is easy.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{\nameref{subsubsec:Sequential_Access}}.
  \nameref{def:File_System} remembers the disk address of the last block referenced and reads the next block.
\item \textbf{\nameref{subsubsec:Direct_Access}} to block $i$ of a file that starts at block $b$, we can immediately access block $b + i$.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Disadvantages of Contiguous Allocation}\label{par:Contiguous_File_Allocation_Disadvantages}
\begin{definition}[Allocation Problem]\label{def:Allocation_Problem}
  The \emph{Allocation Problem} involves how to satisfy a request of size $n$ from a list of free holes.
  If the holes are not organized, i.e.\ there are enough blocks but they are not contiguous, then the request cannot be serviced.
