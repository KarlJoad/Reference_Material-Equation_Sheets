\subsection{File System Implementation}\label{subsec:FS_Implementation}
Several on-disk and in-memory structures are used to implement a \nameref{def:File_System}.
These structures vary depending on the operating system and the file system, but some general principles apply.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Boot Control Block (per volume, if needed).
  Contains information needed by the system to boot an operating system from that volume.
  If the disk does not contain an operating system, this block can be empty.
  It is typically the first block of a volume.
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item In UFS, it is the boot block.
  \item In NTFS, it is the boot sector.
  \end{itemize}

\item Volume Control Block (per volume).
  contains volume (or partition) details, such as:
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Number of blocks in the partition,
  \item Size of the blocks,
  \item Free-block count
  \item Free-block pointers
  \item Free-\nameref{def:File_Control_Block} count
  \item FCB pointers
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item In UFS, this is called a superblock.
  \item In NTFS, it is stored in the master file table.
  \end{itemize}

\item Directory Structure (per file system) is used to organize the files.

\item Per-file \nameref{def:File_Control_Block}.
  Contains many details about the file.
  It has a unique identifier number to allow association with a directory entry.
\end{itemize}
