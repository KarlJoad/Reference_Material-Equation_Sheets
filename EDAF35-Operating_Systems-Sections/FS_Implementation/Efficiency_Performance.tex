\subsection{Efficiency and Performance}\label{subsec:Efficiency_Performance}
Disks are the major bottleneck in local system performance, since they are the slowest main computer component.

\subsubsection{Efficiency}\label{subsubsec:Efficiency}
The efficient use of disk space depends on the disk-allocation and directory algorithms.
For example, \textsc{unix} \nameref{par:Inode}s are preallocated on and spread across the volume.
Thus, even an empty disk has a percentage of its space lost to \texttt{inode}s.
However, preallocating the \texttt{inode}s improves the \nameref{def:File_System}'s performance.
This comes from the allocation and free-space algorithms, which try to keep a file’s data blocks near that file’s \texttt{inode} block to reduce seek time.
