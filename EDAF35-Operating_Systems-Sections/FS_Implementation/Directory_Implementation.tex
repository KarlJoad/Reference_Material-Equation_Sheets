\subsection{Directory Implementation}\label{subsec:Directory_Implementation}
The selection of directory-allocation and directory-management algorithms significantly affects the efficiency, performance, and reliability of the file system.

\subsubsection{Linear List}\label{subsubsec:Linear_List_Directory}
The simplest method of implementing a directory is to use a linear list of file names with pointers to the data blocks.
This method is simple to program but time-consuming to execute.
