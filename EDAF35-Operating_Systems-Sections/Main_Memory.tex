\section{Main Memory}\label{sec:Main_Memory}
To truly benefit from \nameref{sec:CPU_Scheduling_Synchronization}, discussed in \Cref{sec:CPU_Scheduling_Synchronization}, we must be able to keep multiple \nameref{def:Process}es in memory at the same time.

In a \nameref{def:CPU}, the only things that can be accessed directly are \nameref{def:Register}s and main memory.
The CPU can reach the registers within one clock cycle, but accessing main memory takes several clock cycles, because access is done through the memory bus.
To prevent \nameref{def:Memory_Stall}s, we can use multiple \nameref{def:Thread}s, and we can add additional \nameref{def:Cache}s to the CPU itself.
This \nameref{def:Hardware} automatically speeds up memory access, without \nameref{def:Operating_System} intervention.

\begin{definition}[Cache]\label{def:Cache}
  A \emph{cache} is a very small amount of memory, built onto the \nameref{def:CPU} itself, and acts as a buffer between the CPU and main memory.
  A cache will have a copy of a small portion of what is in main memory, and the CPU goes to find the next thing, whatever it may be, from the cache first.
  Because the cache sits on the CPU itself, and does not have to interact with the memory bus, it is significantly faster than accessing main memory, but still slightly slower than accessing a register.
