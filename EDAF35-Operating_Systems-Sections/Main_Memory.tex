\section{Main Memory}\label{sec:Main_Memory}
To truly benefit from \nameref{sec:CPU_Scheduling_Synchronization}, discussed in \Cref{sec:CPU_Scheduling_Synchronization}, we must be able to keep multiple \nameref{def:Process}es in memory at the same time.

In a \nameref{def:CPU}, the only things that can be accessed directly are \nameref{def:Register}s and main memory.
The CPU can reach the registers within one clock cycle, but accessing main memory takes several clock cycles, because access is done through the memory bus.
To prevent \nameref{def:Memory_Stall}s, we can use multiple \nameref{def:Thread}s, and we can add additional \nameref{def:Cache}s to the CPU itself.
This \nameref{def:Hardware} automatically speeds up memory access, without \nameref{def:Operating_System} intervention.
