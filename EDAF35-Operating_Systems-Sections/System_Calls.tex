\section{System Calls}\label{sec:System_Calls}
\begin{definition}[System Call]\label{def:System_Call}
  Software may trigger an interrupt by executing a special operation called a \emph{system call}.
  This can also be called a monitor call.
  A system call is a messaging interface between applications and the \nameref{def:Kernel}, with the applications issuing various requests and the \nameref{def:Kernel} fulfilling them or returning an error.

  System calls provide an interface to the services made available by an \nameref{def:Operating_System}.
  These services are a set of interfaces by which \nameref{def:Process}es running in \nameref{def:User}-space can interact with the system.
  These interfaces give \nameref{def:User}-level applications:
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Controlled access to hardware
  \item A mechanism with which to create new \nameref{def:Process}es
  \item A mechanism to communicate with existing ones
  \item The capability to request other \nameref{def:Operating_System} resources
  \end{itemize}

  These calls are generally available as routines written in C and C++.
  Some of the lowest-level tasks (for example, tasks where hardware must be accessed directly) may be written using assembly.

  \begin{remark}[Syscall]\label{rmk:Syscall}
    In UNIX and UNIX-like systems, \nameref{def:System_Call} is usually shortened to \emph{syscall}.
  \end{remark}
\end{definition}

There are roughly 6 different types of system calls:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item \nameref{subsubsec:Process_Control}
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item End, Abort
  \item Load, Execute
  \item Create \nameref{def:Process}, Terminate \nameref{def:Process}
  \item Get process attributes, Set process attributes
  \item Wait for time
  \item Wait event, Signal event
  \item Allocate and Free memory
  \end{itemize}
\item \nameref{subsubsec:File_Manipulation}
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Create file, Delete file
  \item Open, Close
  \item Read, Write, Reposition
  \item Get file attributes, Set file attributes
  \end{itemize}
\item \nameref{subsubsec:Device_Manipulation}
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Request device, Release device
  \item Read, Write, Reposition
  \item Get device attributes, Set device attributes
  \item Logically attach or detach devices
  \end{itemize}
\item \nameref{subsubsec:Information_Maintenance}
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Get time or date, Set time or date
  \item Get system data, Set system data
  \item Get \nameref{def:Process}, File, or Device attributes
  \item Set \nameref{def:Process}, File, or Device attributes
  \end{itemize}
\item \nameref{subsubsec:Communications}
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Create, Delete communication connection
  \item Send, Receive messages
  \item Transfer status information
  \item Attach or Detach remote devices
  \end{itemize}
\item \nameref{subsubsec:Protection}
\end{enumerate}

\nameref{def:System_Call}s provide a layer between the hardware and \nameref{def:User}-space \nameref{def:Process}es.
This layer serves three primary purposes.
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item It provides an abstracted hardware interface for \nameref{def:User}-space programs.
  When reading or writing from a file, applications do not have to be concerned with the type of disk, media, or even the type of filesystem on which the file resides.
\item \nameref{def:System_Call}s ensure system security and stability.
  With the \nameref{def:Kernel} acting as a middle-man between system resources and \nameref{def:User}-space, the \nameref{def:Kernel} can arbitrate access based on permissions, \nameref{def:User}s, and other criteria.
  This arbitration prevents applications from incorrectly using hardware, stealing other \nameref{def:Process}es’ resources, or otherwise doing harm to the system.
\item There is a single common layer between \nameref{def:User}-space and the rest of the system allows for the virtualized system provided to \nameref{def:Process}es.
\end{enumerate}

\nameref{def:System_Call}s are exposed to the programmer by an \nameref{def:API}.
\begin{definition}[Application Programming Interface]\label{def:API}
  An \emph{Application Programming Interface} (\emph{API}) specifies a set of functions that are available to an application programmer.
  They specify the parameters that are passed to each function and the return values the programmer can expect.

  Typically, API calls perform \nameref{def:System_Call}s in the background, without the programmer knowing about them.
\end{definition}

The system call interface in Linux, as with most UNIX systems, is provided in part by the C library.
The C library implements the main \nameref{def:API} on Unix systems, including the standard C library and the system call interface.
The C library is used by all C programs and is easily wrapped by other programming languages for use in their programs.
POSIX is composed of a series of standards from the IEEE that aim to provide a portable \nameref{def:Operating_System} standard roughly based on UNIX.\@

\subsection{How to Use Syscalls}\label{subsec:How_To_Use_Syscalls}
\nameref{def:System_Call}s (often called \nameref{rmk:Syscall}s in Linux) are typically accessed via functionsdefined in the standard C library.
These functions can define an arbitrary number of arguments and might\footnote{Nearly all system calls have a side effect (they result in some change of the system’s state). A few syscalls, such as \mintinline{c}{getpid()}, do not have side effects and just return data from the \nameref{def:Kernel}.} result in one or more side effects, for example writing to a file or copying some data into a provided pointer.

\nameref{def:System_Call}s also provide a return value of type \mintinline{c}{long} that signifies success or error.
Usually, though not always, a negative return value denotes an error.
A return value of zero is usually (but again, not always) a sign of success.

The C library, when a \nameref{def:System_Call} returns an error, writes a special error code into the global \mintinline{c}{errno} variable.
This variable can be translated into human-readable errors via library functions such as \mintinline{c}{perror()}.

Finally, \nameref{def:System_Call}s have well-defined behavior.
For example, the \nameref{def:System_Call} \mintinline{c}{getpid()} is defined to return an integer that is the current \nameref{def:Process}’s PID.\@
However, the definition of behavior says nothing of the implementation to achieve this behavior.
The \nameref{def:Kernel} must provide the intended behavior of the \nameref{def:System_Call} but is free to do so with whatever implementation it wants as long as the result is correct.
