\section{I/O Systems}\label{sec:IO_Systems}
Because I/O devices vary so widely in their function and speed, varied methods are needed to control them.
These methods form the I/O subsystem of the kernel, which separates the rest of the kernel from the complexities of managing I/O devices.

To encapsulate the details and oddities of different devices, the kernel of an operating system is structured to use \nameref{def:Device_Driver} modules.
