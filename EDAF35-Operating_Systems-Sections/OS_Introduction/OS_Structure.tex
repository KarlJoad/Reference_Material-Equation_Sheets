\subsection{Operating System Structure}\label{subsec:OS_Structure}
\subsubsection{Layered Kernels}\label{subsubsec:Layered_Kernels}
A system as large and complex as a modern operating system must be engineered carefully if it is to function properly and be modified easily.

\subsubsection{Monolithic Approach}\label{subsubsec:Monolithic_Approach}
Many operating systems do not have well-defined structures.
Frequently, such systems started as small, simple, and limited systems and then grew beyond their original scope.
MS-DOS is an example of such a system.
It was originally designed and implemented by a few people who had no idea that it would become so popular.
It was written to provide the most functionality in the least space, so it was not carefully divided into modules.
