\subsection{Access Methods}\label{subsec:Access_Methods}
\nameref{def:File}s store information.
When they are used, this information must be accessed and read into computer memory.
The 2 main ways to access the content of a file are:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item \nameref{subsubsec:Sequential_Access}
\item \nameref{subsubsec:Direct_Access}
\end{enumerate}

Not all operating systems support both \nameref{subsubsec:Sequential_Access} and \nameref{subsubsec:Direct_Access} for files.
Some systems allow only sequential file access; others allow only direct access.
Some systems require that a file be defined as sequential or direct when it is created.
Such a file can be accessed only in a manner consistent with its declaration.
