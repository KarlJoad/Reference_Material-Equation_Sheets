\subsection{File System Mounting}\label{subsec:File_System_Mounting}
Just as a \nameref{def:File} must be opened before it is used, a \nameref{def:File_System} must be mounted before it can be available to \nameref{def:Process}es on the system.
Specifically, the directory structure may be built out of multiple \nameref{def:Volume}s, which must be mounted to make them available within the file-system name space.

\begin{definition}[Mount Point]\label{def:Mount_Point}
  A \emph{mount point} is a location within the file structure where the file system will be attached.
