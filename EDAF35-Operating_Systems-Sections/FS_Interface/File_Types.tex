\subsection{File Types}\label{subsec:File_Types}
We need to decide whether the operating system should recognize and support \nameref{def:File} types.
If an operating system recognizes the type of a file, it can then operate on the file in reasonable ways.

A common technique for implementing \nameref{def:File} types is to include the type as part of the file name.
The name is split into two parts: the name and the extension, which are separated by a period.
This way, the user \textbf{and} the operating system can tell from the name alone what the type of a file is.
