\subsection{Protection}\label{subsec:File_Protection}
When information is stored in a computer system, we want to keep it safe from improper access.

Most systems have evolved to use the concepts of file \nameref{def:File_Owner} and \nameref{def:File_Group}.

\subsubsection{Types of Access}\label{subsubsec:Types_File_Access}
The need to protect files is a direct result of the ability to access files.
Systems that do not permit access to the files of other users do not need protection.
Protection mechanisms provide controlled access by limiting the types of file access that can be made.
Access is permitted or denied depending on several factors, one of which is the type of access requested.
Several different types of operations may be controlled:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{Read}.
 Read from the file.
\item \textbf{Write}.
 Write or rewrite the file.
\item \textbf{Execute}.
 Load the file into memory and execute it.
\item \textbf{Append}.
 Write new information at the end of the file.
\item \textbf{Delete}.
 Delete the file and free its space for possible reuse.
\item \textbf{List}.
 List the name and attributes of the file.
\end{itemize}

Other, higher-level, operations, such as renaming, copying, and editing the file, may also be controlled.
For many systems, however, these functions may be implemented by a program that makes lower-level system calls.
File protection is provided at only the lower level.
