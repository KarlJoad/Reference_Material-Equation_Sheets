\subsection{File Sharing}\label{subsec:File_Sharing}
File sharing is very desirable for users who want to collaborate and to reduce the effort required to achieve a computing goal.
Therefore, user-oriented operating systems must accommodate the need to share files in spite of the inherent difficulties.

\subsubsection{Multiple Users}\label{subsubsec:File_Sharing-Multiple_Users}
Given a directory structure that allows files to be shared by users, the system must mediate the file sharing.
The system can either allow a user to access the files of other users by default or require that a user specifically grant access to the files.
To implement sharing and protection, the system must maintain more file and directory attributes than are needed on a single-user system.
Typically, this involves recording the \nameref{def:File_Owner} and the \nameref{def:File_Group} to determine access.

This is discussed more in \Cref{subsec:File_Protection}.
