\subsection{Directory and Disk Structure}\label{subsec:Directory_Disk_Structure}
Each \nameref{def:Volume} that contains a \nameref{def:File_System} must also contain information about the \nameref{def:File}s in the system.
This information is kept in entries in a device directory (A volume's Table of Contents).
The device directory (commonly, the \nameref{def:Directory}) records information—such as name, location, size, and type—for all files on that volume.
