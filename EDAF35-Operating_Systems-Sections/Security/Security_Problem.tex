\subsection{The Security Problem}\label{subsec:Security_Problem}
In \Cref{sec:Protection}, we discussed mechanisms that the operating system can provide that allow users to protect their resources.
These mechanisms work well \textbf{only} as long as the users conform to the intended use of and access to these resources.

A system is secure if its resources are used and accessed as intended under \textbf{all} circumstances.
Unfortunately, total security cannot be achieved.
Nonetheless, there must have mechanisms to make security breaches a rare occurrence, rather than the norm.
