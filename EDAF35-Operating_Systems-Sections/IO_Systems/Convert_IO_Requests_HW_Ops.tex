\subsection{Convert I/O Requests to Hardware Operations}\label{subsec:Convert_IO_Requests_HW_Ops}
Up to this point, no explanation has been given for how the \nameref{def:Operating_System} connects an application's request to a set of wires or hardware.

In the case of a \nameref{def:File} lookup, there are 2 methods:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item The \nameref{def:Path_Name} also specifies the \nameref{def:Volume} or disk that the file is on.
  Windows/MS-DOS use this.
\item The device name space is incorporated into the regular \nameref{def:File_System} namespace.
  \textsc{unix} uses this.
\end{enumerate}
