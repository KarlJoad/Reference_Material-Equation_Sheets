\subsection{STREAMS}\label{subsec:STREAMS}
\textsc{streams} enable an application to assemble pipelines of driver code dynamically.
A stream is a full-duplex connection between a device driver and a user-level process.
It consists of:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item a \textbf{stream head} that interfaces with the user process
\item a \textbf{driver end} that controls the device
\item zero or more \textbf{stream modules} between the stream head and the driver end
\end{enumerate}

Each of these components contains a read queue and a write queue.
Message passing is used to transfer data between queues.
