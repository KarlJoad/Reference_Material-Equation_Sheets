\subsection{Demand Paging}\label{subsec:Demand_Paging}
Because we can support the ability to \nameref{def:Dynamic_Loading} \nameref{def:Program}s, we don't need to load the \textbf{entire} program into memory initially.
For example, suppose a program starts with a list of available options from which the user is to select.
Loading the entire program into memory means loading the executable code for \textbf{ALL} options, no matter what option is chosen.

If we chose to load in parts of a \nameref{def:Program} only when they are needed, this is \nameref{def:Demand_Paging}.
