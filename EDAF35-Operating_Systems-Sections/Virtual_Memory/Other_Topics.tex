\subsection{Other Topics to Consider}\label{subsec:Other_Topics_to_Consider}
Here, we mention considerations, other than a \nameref{def:Page_Replacement} algorithm and frame allocation policy to choosing how to create our \nameref{def:Paging} system.

\subsubsection{Prepaging}\label{subsubsec:Prepaging}
An obvious property of pure \nameref{def:Demand_Paging} is the large number of \nameref{def:Page_Fault}s that occur when a \nameref{def:Process} is started or when a swapped out process is restarted.
This situation results from trying to get the initially executing locality into memory.
\nameref{def:Prepaging} helps ease this situation.
