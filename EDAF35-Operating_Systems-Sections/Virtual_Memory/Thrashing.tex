\subsection{Thrashing}\label{subsec:Thrashing}
If a \nameref{def:Process} does not have the number of frames (\nameref{def:Physical_Memory}) it needs to support pages in active use, it will quickly page-fault.
At this point, it must replace some pages.
However, since all the pages are in active use, the OS will replace a page that will be needed again right away.
Consequently, the process faults repeatedly, replacing pages that it must bring back in immediately.

\begin{definition}[Thrashing]\label{def:Thrashing}
  \emph{Thrashing} is when a \nameref{def:Process} is spending more time \nameref{def:Paging} than executing.
  This happens when there are not enough frames in the system to support the number of pages the process needs.
  The \nameref{def:Page_Replacement} algorithm will replace some pages that the process needs right now, so it must page the first one back in, overwritting another page that is needed.
  Thus, the cycle continues.
