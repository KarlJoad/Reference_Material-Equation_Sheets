\subsection{Disk Structure}\label{subsec:Disk_Structure}
Here, we view all potential storage media (\Cref{subsec:Structure_Storage_Media}) as being the same.

Drives are addressed as large one-dimensional arrays of \nameref{def:Logical_Block}s.

\begin{definition}[Logical Block]\label{def:Logical_Block}
  The \emph{logical block} is the smallest unit of transfer.
  The size of a logical block is usually 512 bytes, although some disks can use a different \nameref{def:Low_Level_Formatting} to have a different logical block size, such as 1,024 bytes.
