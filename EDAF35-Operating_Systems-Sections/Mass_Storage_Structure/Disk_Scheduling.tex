\subsection{Disk Scheduling}\label{subsec:Disk_Scheduling}
Just like with CPU~\nameref{subsec:Scheduling} and \nameref{sec:Virtual_Memory}, the \nameref{def:Operating_System} attempts to maximize the efficient use of hardware resources.
For disk drives, this means minimizing access time and maximizing bandwidth.

\begin{definition}[Disk Bandwidth]\label{def:Disk_Bandwidth}
  The \emph{disk bandwidth} is the total number of bytes transferred, divided by the total time between the first request for service and the completion of the last transfer.

  The service time will include the seek time (time for disk arm to move heads to cylinder) and the rotational latency (time for platter to spin to correct sector).
\end{definition}
