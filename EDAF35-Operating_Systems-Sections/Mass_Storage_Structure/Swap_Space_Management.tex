\subsection{Swap-Space Management}\label{subsec:Swap_Space_Management}
Swap-space management is another low-level task of the \nameref{def:Operating_System}.
\nameref{def:Swapping} occurs when the amount of physical memory reaches a critically low point and \nameref{def:Process}es are moved from memory to swap space to free available \nameref{def:Physical_Memory}.
\nameref{def:Virtual_Memory} uses disk space as an extension of main memory.

Most systems combine swapping with virtual memory techniques and swap pages, not necessarily entire processes.
In addition, most swapping systems only swap \nameref{def:Anonymous_Memory}.
``\nameref{def:Swapping}'' and ``\nameref{def:Paging}'' are used interchangeably now.
