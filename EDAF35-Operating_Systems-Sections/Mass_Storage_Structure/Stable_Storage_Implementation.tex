\subsection{Stable-Storage Implementation}\label{subsec:Stable_Storage_Implementation}
\begin{definition}[Stable-Storage]\label{def:Stable_Storage}
  \emph{Stable-Storage} is a secondary storage medium where the data it contains is never lost.
\end{definition}

To implement such storage, we need:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item To replicate the required information on multiple storage devices with independent failure modes.
\item To coordinate the writing of updates in a way that guarantees that a failure during an update will not leave all the copies in a damaged state.
\item When we are recovering from a failure, we can force all copies to a consistent and correct value, even if another failure occurs during the recovery.
\end{itemize}
