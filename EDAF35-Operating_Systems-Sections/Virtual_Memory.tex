\begin{definition}[Virtual Memory]\label{def:Virtual_Memory}
  Virtual memory involves the separation of logical memory as perceived
  by users from physical memory.
  This separation allows an extremely large virtual memory to be provided for programmers when only a smaller physical memory is available.
  Virtual memory makes the task of programming much easier, because the programmer no longer needs to worry about the amount of physical memory available; she can concentrate instead on the problem to be programmed.
