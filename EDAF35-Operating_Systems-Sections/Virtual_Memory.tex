\section{Virtual Memory}\label{sec:Virtual_Memory}
As our natural definition of Von Neumann computers, the instructions being executed must be in \nameref{def:Physical_Memory}.
Thus, the first approach to meeting this requirement is to place the entire \nameref{def:Logical_Address_Space} in physical memory.
This is unfortunate, since it limits the size of a program to the size of physical memory.
\nameref{def:Dynamic_Loading} can help ease this restriction, but it generally requires special precautions and extra work by the programmer.

\begin{definition}[Virtual Memory]\label{def:Virtual_Memory}
  Virtual memory involves the separation of logical memory as perceived
  by users from physical memory.
  This separation allows an extremely large virtual memory to be provided for programmers when only a smaller physical memory is available.
  Virtual memory makes the task of programming much easier, because the programmer no longer needs to worry about the amount of physical memory available; she can concentrate instead on the problem to be programmed.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Physical Memory]\label{def:Physical_Memory}
  \emph{Physical memory} is the memory that is physically installed in the computer.
  There is a finite amount of this, determined by how much is installed by the system designer.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Virtual Address Space]\label{def:Virtual_Address_Space}
  The \emph{virtual address space} of a \nameref{def:Process} consists of all the \nameref{def:Virtual_Address}es generated by a \nameref{def:Program}.
  It refers to the logical (virtual) view of \textbf{how a \nameref{def:Process} is stored in memory}.
  Typically, this view is one of perfectly continguous memory locations.

  \begin{remark}
    The \nameref{def:Virtual_Address_Space} is only calculated by one \nameref{def:Program}/\nameref{def:Process} at a time.
    To find the total virtual address space used, all \nameref{def:Process}es must have their virtual address spaces aggregated.
  \end{remark}
\end{definition}
