\begin{definition}[Port]\label{def:Network_Port}
  A \emph{port} is a single instance of a data flow.
  There are many different flows of data.
  These may be from different applications or different instances of the same application.
  In both TCP and UDP, flows are given unique \emph{port numbers}.

  Some of these are standard for particular applications, e.g.\ port 80 for HTTP (web), port 25 for SMTP (email).
  The transport protocol uses the port number to deliver data to the correct application.

  \begin{remark}[Port Confusion]\label{rmk:Network_Port_Confusion}
    It is important to note that the \nameref{def:Software_Port} is \textbf{\emph{NOT}} the same thing as a \nameref{def:Network_Port}.
