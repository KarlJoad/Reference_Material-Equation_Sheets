A computer system is a collection of \nameref{def:Process}es and objects.
Objects refer to:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Hardware Objects
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item CPU
  \item Memory Segments
  \item Printers
  \item Disks
  \item Tape Drives
  \end{itemize}
\item Software Objects
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Files
  \item Programs
  \item Semaphores
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Each object has a unique name that differentiates it from all other objects in the system, and each can be accessed only through well-defined and meaningful operations.
The operations that are possible depends on the object in question.
For example, on a CPU, we can perform executions, memory can be read from and written to, etc.
