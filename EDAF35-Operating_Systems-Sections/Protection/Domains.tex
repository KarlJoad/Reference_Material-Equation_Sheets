\subsection{Domains of Protection}\label{subsec:Domains_of_Protection}
A computer system is a collection of \nameref{def:Process}es and objects.
Objects refer to:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Hardware Objects
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item CPU
  \item Memory Segments
  \item Printers
  \item Disks
  \item Tape Drives
  \end{itemize}
\item Software Objects
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Files
  \item Programs
  \item Semaphores
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Each object has a unique name that differentiates it from all other objects in the system, and each can be accessed only through well-defined and meaningful operations.
The operations that are possible depends on the object in question.
For example, on a CPU, we can perform executions, memory can be read from and written to, etc.

A \nameref{def:Process} should be allowed to access only those resources for which it has authorization.
Furthermore, at any time, a process should be able to access only those resources that it currently requires to complete its task.
This second requirement, is commonly referred to as the \nameref{def:Need_To_Know_Principle}.

\begin{definition}[Need-to-Know Principle]\label{def:Need_To_Know_Principle}
  The \emph{Need-to-Know principle} states that a \nameref{def:Process} should be able to access \textbf{only} those resources that it currently requires to complete its \textbf{current} task.

  This is useful in limiting the amount of damage a faulty process can cause in the system.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Domain Structure}\label{subsubsec:Domain_Structure}
A \nameref{def:Process} operates within a \nameref{def:Protection_Domain}.

\begin{definition}[Protection Domain]\label{def:Protection_Domain}
  A \emph{protection domain} specifies the resources that a \nameref{def:Process} may access.
  Each domain defines a set of objects and \nameref{def:Access_Right}s.
  A domain is a collection of access rights, each of which is an ordered pair

  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Protection_Domain}
    \langle \text{object-name}, \text{rights-set} \rangle
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}

A \nameref{def:Protection_Domain} can be defined in many ways.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Each user may be a domain. In this case, the set of objects that
  can be accessed depends on the identity of the user. Domain
  switching occurs when the user is changed â€”generally when one user
  logs out and another user logs in.
\item Each process may be a domain.
  In this case, the set of objects that can be accessed depends on the
  identity of the process. Domain switching occurs when one process
  sends a message to another process and then waits for a response.
\item Each procedure may be a domain. In this case, the set of objects
  that can be accessed corresponds to the local variables defined
  within the procedure. Domain switching occurs when a procedure call
  is made.
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}[Access Right]\label{def:Access_Right}
  The ability to execute an operation on an object is an \emph{access right}.
\end{definition}

\nameref{def:Protection_Domain}s may share \nameref{def:Access_Right}s.
For example, if we have three domains: $D_{1}$, $D_{2}$, and $D_{3}$ an an access right $\langle O_{4}, \text{print} \rangle$ that is shared by $D_{2}$ and $D_{3}$, a process executing in either of these domains can print object $O_{4}$.
