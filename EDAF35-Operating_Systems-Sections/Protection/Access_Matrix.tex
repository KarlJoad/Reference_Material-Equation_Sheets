\subsection{Access Matrix}\label{subsec:Access_Matrix}
A general model of protection can be viewed abstractly as a matrix, called an \nameref{def:Access_Matrix}.
\begin{definition}[Access Matrix]\label{def:Access_Matrix}
  An \emph{access matrix} is a way to represent the access rights between \nameref{def:Protection_Domain}s and objects.
  The rows of the access matrix are the domains, and the columns represent objects.
  Each entry in the matrix consists of a set of \nameref{def:Access_Right}s.
  The entry \texttt{access($i$,$j$)} defines the set of operations that a process executing in domain $D_{i}$ can invoke on object $O_{j}$.

  \begin{remark}
    Because the column defines objects explicitly, we can omit the object name from the \nameref{def:Access_Right}.
  \end{remark}
\end{definition}
