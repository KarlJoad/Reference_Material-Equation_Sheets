\subsection{Principles of Protection}\label{subsec:Protection_Principles}
Principles that are used for protection allow us to make decisions about what policies to set on a system and what mechanisms enforce those policies.
A key, time-tested principle for protection is the \nameref{def:Principle_Least_Privilege}.

\begin{definition}[Principle of Least Privilege]\label{def:Principle_Least_Privilege}
  The \emph{principle of least privilege} states that programs, users, and even systems be given just enough privileges to perform their tasks.
\end{definition}
