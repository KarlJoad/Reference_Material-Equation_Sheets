\subsection{Implementing Access Matrices}\label{subsec:Implement_Access_Matrices}
In general, an \nameref{def:Access_Matrix} will be sparse, i.e.\ most of the entries in the table will be empty.
Along with this, traditional sparse data structure techniques are not terribly useful for this.
These are because of the way the protection facilities are used.

Most systems use a combination of \nameref{def:Access_List}s and \nameref{def:Capability_List}s.
When a \nameref{def:Process} first tries to access an object, the access list is searched.
If access is denied, an exception condition occurs.
Otherwise, a capability is created and attached to the process.
Subsequent references use the capability to quickly determine access.
After the last access, the capability is destroyed.
