\subsection{Linux Implementation of Threads}\label{subsec:Linux_Implementation_Threads}
\nameref{def:Thread}s are a popular modern programming abstraction.
They provide multiple executors within the same program in a shared memory address space.
They can also share open files and other resources.
\nameref{def:Thread}s enable concurrent programming and, on multiple processor systems, true parallelism.

The Linux kernel is unique in that there is no concept of a \nameref{def:Thread}.
Instead, Linux implements all \nameref{def:Thread}s as standard \nameref{def:Process}es.
The Linux kernel does not provide any special scheduling semantics or data structures to represent \nameref{def:Thread}s.
Instead, a \nameref{def:Thread} is merely a \nameref{def:Process} that shares certain resources with other \nameref{def:Process}es.
Each \nameref{def:Thread} has a unique \mintinline{c}{task_struct} and appears to the kernel as a normal \nameref{def:Process} which just happen to share resources, such as an address space, with other \nameref{def:Process}es.

For example, assume you have a \nameref{def:Process} that consists of four \nameref{def:Thread}s.
In Linux, there are simply four \nameref{def:Process}es and thus four normal \mintinline{c}{task_struct} structures.
The four \nameref{def:Process}es are set up to share certain resources.
The result is quite elegant.
However, on systems with explicit \nameref{def:Thread} support, one \nameref{def:Process_Descriptor} might exist that points to the four different \nameref{def:Thread}s.
The \nameref{def:Process_Descriptor} describes the shared resources, such as an address space or open files.
The \nameref{def:Thread}s then describe the resources they alone possess.

\subsubsection{Creating Threads}\label{subsubsec:Creating_Threads}
\nameref{def:Thread}s are created the same as normal \nameref{def:Process}es, i.e.\ \mintinline{c}{fork()} is used.
The difference is that the \mintinline{c}{clone()} \nameref{def:System_Call} is passed flags corresponding to the specific resources to be shared.
