\subsection{Process Creation}\label{subsec:Process_Creation}
Most operating systems implement a \texttt{spawn} mechanism to create a new process in a new address space, read in an executable, and begin executing it.
UNIX takes the unusual approach of separating these steps into two distinct functions: \mintinline{c}{fork()} and \mintinline{c}{exec()}.
The first, \mintinline{c}{fork()}, creates a child process that is a copy of the current task.
It differs from the parent only in:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Its PID (which is unique)
\item Its PPID (parentâ€™s PID, which is set to the original process)
\item Certain resources and statistics, such as pending signals, which are not inherited
\end{itemize}

The second function, \mintinline{c}{exec()}, loads a new executable into the address space and begins executing it.
