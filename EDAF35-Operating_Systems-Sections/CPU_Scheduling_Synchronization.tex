\section{CPU Scheduling and Synchronization}\label{sec:CPU_Scheduling_Synchronization}
The growing importance of multicore systems has brought an increased emphasis on developing multithreaded applications.
In such applications, several threads, which may be sharing data, are running in parallel on different processing cores.
These \nameref{def:Process}es are called \nameref{def:Cooperating_Process}es.

\begin{definition}[Deadlock]\label{def:Deadlock}
  \emph{Deadlock} is when 2 processes require information from each other to continue running.
  If this happens, neither process will provide the other with its required information, so they will both wait for each other, forever.
