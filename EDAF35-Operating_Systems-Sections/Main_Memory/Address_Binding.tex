\subsection{Address Binding}\label{subsec:Address_Binding}
Just as in programming languages, there are different possible times when a \nameref{def:Program} stored on a disk can have \nameref{def:Memory} addresses bound to it, this is called \nameref{def:Address_Binding}.

\begin{definition}[Address Binding]\label{def:Address_Binding}
  \emph{Address binding} is the act of putting ``something'' (a variable, a function, a value, anything) at a location in \nameref{def:Memory}.
  Because these memory locations have unique addresses assigned to them, the ``something'' that was put there is bound to that memory address.
\end{definition}

For a \nameref{def:Program} to be executed, it must be brought into memory and placed within a \nameref{def:Process}.
The processes that are waiting for their binary images to be brought to memory from the disk before beginning execution form the \nameref{def:Input_Queue}.

\begin{definition}[Input Queue]\label{def:Input_Queue}
  The \emph{input queue} is the queue in which \nameref{def:Process}es are placed while they wait for their \nameref{def:Program} binary image to arrive from the disk.
\end{definition}

There are 3 major times when \nameref{def:Address_Binding} can occur:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item \nameref{subsubsec:Compile_Time_Address_Binding}
\item \nameref{subsubsec:Load_Time_Address_Binding}
\item \nameref{subsubsec:Execution_Time_Address_Binding}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Compile-Time Address Binding}\label{subsubsec:Compile_Time_Address_Binding}
If the addresses that the \nameref{def:Process} will use are known at compile-time, then \nameref{def:Absolute_Code} can be generated.

\begin{definition}[Absolute Code]\label{def:Absolute_Code}
  In \emph{absolute code}, the memory location of the \nameref{def:Process} is fixed during every execution, and because the \nameref{def:Program} is always the same size, anything that requires a memory can be referenced by this unchanging value.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Load-Time Address Binding}\label{subsubsec:Load_Time_Address_Binding}
\subsubsection{Execution-Time Address Binding}\label{subsubsec:Execution_Time_Address_Binding}
