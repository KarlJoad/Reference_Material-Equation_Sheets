\subsection{Address Binding}\label{subsec:Address_Binding}
Just as in programming languages, there are different possible times when a \nameref{def:Program} stored on a disk can have \nameref{def:Memory} addresses bound to it, this is called \nameref{def:Address_Binding}.

\begin{definition}[Address Binding]\label{def:Address_Binding}
  \emph{Address binding} is the act of putting ``something'' (a variable, a function, a value, anything) at a location in \nameref{def:Memory}.
  Because these memory locations have unique addresses assigned to them, the ``something'' that was put there is bound to that memory address.
\end{definition}
