\subsection{Contiguous Memory Allocation}\label{subsec:Contiguous_Memory_Allocation}
Main memory must contain everything for the system to run, including both the \nameref{def:Operating_System} and \nameref{def:User} \nameref{def:Process}es.
It is our jobs, as operating system engineers to make the allocation of memory for the \nameref{def:Operating_System} as efficient as possible.
The earliest and simplest method is that of \nameref{def:Contiguous_Memory_Allocation}.
