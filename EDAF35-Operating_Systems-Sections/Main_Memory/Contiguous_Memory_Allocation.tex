\subsection{Contiguous Memory Allocation}\label{subsec:Contiguous_Memory_Allocation}
Main memory must contain everything for the system to run, including both the \nameref{def:Operating_System} and \nameref{def:User} \nameref{def:Process}es.
It is our jobs, as operating system engineers to make the allocation of memory for the \nameref{def:Operating_System} as efficient as possible.
The earliest and simplest method is that of \nameref{def:Contiguous_Memory_Allocation}.

Memory is usually divided into two partitions: one for the \nameref{def:Operating_System} and one for the user processes.
We can place the operating system in either low memory or high memory, depending on the location of the \nameref{def:Interrupt_Vector}.
Typically, the interrupt vector is in low addresses, so the OS is usually put there too.
Throughout this document, we assume that the OS inhabits the lowest addresses.

\begin{definition}[Contiguous Memory Allocation]\label{def:Contiguous_Memory_Allocation}
  In \emph{contiguous memory allocation}, each \nameref{def:Process} is contained in a single contiguous section of memory that is also contiguous with the next process.

  In short, this means that each \nameref{def:Process} sits in its own contiguous block and is right next to the next process.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Memory Protection}\label{subsubsec:Contiguous_Memory_Protection}
In \nameref{def:Contiguous_Memory_Allocation}, we can provide memory protection by using concepts from earlier.
If the \texttt{base} register is considered as the \texttt{relocation} register (because of \nameref{def:Logical_Address} conversion to \nameref{def:Physical_Address}), and use the \texttt{limit} register as before, then we can protect this \nameref{def:Process}.
Since the \nameref{def:Operating_System} is the only entity that can change the values of the \texttt{relocation} and \texttt{limit} registers, this (currently executing) process and others cannot interfere with each other.
