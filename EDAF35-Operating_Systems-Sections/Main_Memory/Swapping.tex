\subsection{Swapping}\label{subsec:Swapping}
A \nameref{def:Process} can only be executed if it is in memory.
However, while it is \textbf{NOT} being executed, it is not required for it to be in memory.
This idea forms the basis of \nameref{def:Swapping}.

\begin{definition}[Swapping]\label{def:Swapping}
  \emph{Swapping} is the action of moving a \nameref{def:Process} out of memory to a \nameref{def:Backing_Store}, or vice versa.
\end{definition}
