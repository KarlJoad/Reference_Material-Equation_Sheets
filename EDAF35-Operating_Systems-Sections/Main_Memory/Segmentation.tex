\subsection{Segmentation}\label{subsec:Segmentation}
Dealing with memory in terms of its physical properties is inconvenient to both the \nameref{def:Operating_System} and the programmer.
If the hardware could provide a memory mechanism that mapped the programmerâ€™s view to the actual physical memory, the system would have more freedom to manage memory, while the programmer would have a more natural programming environment.
\nameref{def:Segmentation} provides such a mechanism.
