\subsection{Paging}\label{subsec:Paging}
Most memory-management schemes used before the introduction of \nameref{def:Paging} suffered from the problem of fitting memory chunks of varying sizes on the \nameref{def:Backing_Store}
This arises because space must be found on the backing store, when main memory needs to be swapped out.
The backing store has the same \nameref{def:Fragmentation} problems discussed in connection with main memory, but access is much slower, so compaction is impossible.

\begin{definition}[Paging]\label{def:Paging}
  \emph{Paging} allows the \nameref{def:Physical_Address_Space} of a \nameref{def:Process} to be noncontiguous.
  This is achieved breaking up \nameref{def:Physical_Memory} and \nameref{def:Logical_Address_Space} into equally, fixed-size blocks.
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item \nameref{def:Physical_Memory} is broken up into \emph{frames}.
  \item \nameref{def:Logical_Address_Space} is broken up into \emph{pages}.
  \item The \nameref{def:Backing_Store} is also broken up, as a multiple (1 through $n$) of the frame size.
  \end{itemize}

  Paging avoids the issue of \nameref{def:External_Fragmentation} and solves the problem of fitting memory chunks of varying sizes on the \nameref{def:Backing_Store}.
  However, \nameref{def:Internal_Fragmentation} is still an issue.
\end{definition}

\nameref{def:Paging} is implemented through cooperation between the operating system and the computer hardware.
Similar to how \nameref{def:Segmentation} has a segment table, \textbf{EACH \nameref{def:Process}} in a \nameref{def:Paging} system has a \nameref{def:Page_Table}.
