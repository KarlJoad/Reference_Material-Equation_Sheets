\subsection{Paging}\label{subsec:Paging}
Most memory-management schemes used before the introduction of \nameref{def:Paging} suffered from the problem of fitting memory chunks of varying sizes on the \nameref{def:Backing_Store}
This arises because space must be found on the backing store, when main memory needs to be swapped out.
The backing store has the same \nameref{def:Fragmentation} problems discussed in connection with main memory, but access is much slower, so compaction is impossible.
