\subsection{Types of Virtualization}\label{subsec:Virtualization_Types}
Here, I discuss the ways that virtual environments are created using \nameref{def:Virtualization} and the \nameref{subsec:Building_Blocks} discussed earlier.
Of course, the hardware on which the virtual machines are running can cause great variation in implementation methods.
Throughout this discussion, it is safe to assume that \nameref{def:VMM}s take advantage of hardware assistance when possible.
