\subsection{Building Blocks}\label{subsec:Building_Blocks}
Although the virtual machine concept is useful, it is difficult to implement.
Much work is required to provide an exact duplicate of the underlying machine.
This is especially a challenge on dual-mode systems, where the underlying machine has only user mode and kernel mode.

\begin{remark*}
  Note that these building blocks are not required by \nameref{def:Type0_Hypervisor}s.
