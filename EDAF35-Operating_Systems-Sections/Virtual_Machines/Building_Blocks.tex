\subsection{Building Blocks}\label{subsec:Building_Blocks}
Although the virtual machine concept is useful, it is difficult to implement.
Much work is required to provide an exact duplicate of the underlying machine.
This is especially a challenge on dual-mode systems, where the underlying machine has only user mode and kernel mode.

\begin{remark*}
  Note that these building blocks are not required by \nameref{def:Type0_Hypervisor}s.
\end{remark*}

The ability to virtualize heavily depends on the hardware features provided by the CPU.\@
If the features are sufficient, then it is possible to write a \nameref{def:VMM} that provides a guest environment.
Otherwise, \nameref{def:Virtualization} is impossible.

If it is possible to virtualize a system, the \nameref{def:VMM}s use several techniques to implement it, including \nameref{subsubsec:Trap_and_Emulate} and \nameref{subsubsec:Binary_Translation}.
