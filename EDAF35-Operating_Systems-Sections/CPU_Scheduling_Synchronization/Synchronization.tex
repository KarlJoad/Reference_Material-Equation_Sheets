\subsection{Process/Thread Synchronization}\label{subsec:Synchronization}
The main problem that occurs in multi\nameref{def:Thread}ed programs is that there is a small portion of code that is a \nameref{def:Critical_Section}.
This leads to the development of the \nameref{subsubsec:Critical_Section_Problem}.

\begin{definition}[Critical Section]\label{def:Critical_Section}
  The \emph{critical section} of a \nameref{def:Process} is a portion where the \nameref{def:Thread} and/or \nameref{def:Process} is changing common variables, updating a table, writing a file, or other global state changes.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Critical Section Problem}\label{subsubsec:Critical_Section_Problem}
The \emph{Critical Section Problem} is the issue of coordinating multiple \nameref{def:Thread}s about a \nameref{def:Critical_Section} of the code.
The problem is to design a protocol that the \nameref{def:Process}es/\nameref{def:Thread}s can use to cooperate.
Each \nameref{def:Process} must request permission to enter its critical section.
The section of code implementing this request is the entry section.
The critical section may be followed by an exit section.
The remaining code is the remainder section.

\begin{definition}[Entry Section]\label{def:Entry_Section}
  The \emph{entry section} of a \nameref{def:Process} is the portion where the request to execute the \nameref{def:Critical_Section} occurs.
  In the case of a \nameref{def:Mutex}, this is the process of aquiring the it.
  For a \nameref{def:Semaphore}, it is the process of manipulating the value it currently contains.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Exit Section]\label{def:Exit_Section}
  In the \emph{exit section}, the constructs used to ensure coordination in the \nameref{def:Critical_Section} are freed.
  In the case of a \nameref{def:Mutex}, this is the process of releasing the it.
  For a \nameref{def:Semaphore}, it is the process of manipulating the value it currently contains in the opposite direction it was initially manipulated by.
\end{definition}
