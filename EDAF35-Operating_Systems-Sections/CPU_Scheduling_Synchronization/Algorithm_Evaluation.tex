\subsection{Algorithm Evaluation}\label{subsec:Algorithm_Evaluation}
Now that we have selected a \nameref{def:Scheduling_Algorithm} to use, how do we know that it was the right choice?
First, we need to know what our criteria were.
Some systems might have multiple criteria at a time, such as:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Maximum CPU response time is 1 second.
\item Turnaround time is (on average) linearly proportional to total execution time.
\end{itemize}
