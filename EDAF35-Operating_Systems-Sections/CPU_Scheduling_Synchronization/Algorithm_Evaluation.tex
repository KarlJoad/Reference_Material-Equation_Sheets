\subsection{Algorithm Evaluation}\label{subsec:Algorithm_Evaluation}
Now that we have selected a \nameref{def:Scheduling_Algorithm} to use, how do we know that it was the right choice?
First, we need to know what our criteria were.
Some systems might have multiple criteria at a time, such as:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Maximum CPU response time is 1 second.
\item Turnaround time is (on average) linearly proportional to total execution time.
\end{itemize}

To do this, there are 4 main ways to do this:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item \nameref{par:Deterministic_Modeling}
\item \nameref{par:Queuing_Models}
\item \nameref{par:Simulations}
\item \nameref{par:Implementation}
\end{enumerate}
