\subsection{Thread Scheduling}\label{subsec:Thread_Scheduling}
\begin{blackbox}
  \textbf{On operating systems that support them, \nameref{def:Kernel_Thread}s, not \nameref{def:Process}es are scheduled by the operating system.}
  However, the terms ``process scheduling'' and ``thread scheduling'' are often used interchangeably.
  Process scheduling is used when discussing general scheduling concepts and thread scheduling to refer to thread-specific ideas.
