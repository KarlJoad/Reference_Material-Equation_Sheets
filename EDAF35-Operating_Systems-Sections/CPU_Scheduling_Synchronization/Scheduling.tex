\subsection{Scheduling}\label{subsec:Scheduling}
CPU scheduling is the basis of multiprogrammed operating systems.
In a single-processor system, only one process can run at a time.
Others must wait until the CPU is free and can be rescheduled.
By switching the CPU among processes, the operating system can maximize CPU utilization.

For example, a \nameref{def:Process} is executed until it must wait.
Typically the process waits for the completion of some I/O request.
In a simple computer system, the CPU then just sits idle.
All this waiting time is wasted; no useful work is accomplished.
