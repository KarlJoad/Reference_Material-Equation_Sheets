\subsection{Scheduling}\label{subsec:Scheduling}
CPU scheduling is the basis of multiprogrammed operating systems.
In a single-processor system, only one process can run at a time.
Others must wait until the CPU is free and can be rescheduled.
By switching the CPU among processes, the operating system can maximize CPU utilization.
