\section{Protection}\label{sec:Protection}
Protection refers to a mechanism for controlling the access of \nameref{def:Program}s, \nameref{def:Process}es, or \nameref{def:User}s to the resources defined by a computer system.
This must provide a means for specifying the controls to be imposed, together with a means of enforcement.
Protection and security mean different things here.
Security is a measure of confidence that the integrity of a system and its data will be preserved.
