\section{Security}\label{sec:Security}
Protection is an \textbf{internal} problem: How do we provide controlled access to programs and data stored in a computer system?
Security, on the other hand, requires not only an adequate protection system but also consideration of the \textbf{external} environment within which the system operates.
A protection system is ineffective if user authentication is compromised or a program is run by an unauthorized user.
Computer resources must be guarded against unauthorized access, malicious destruction or alteration, and accidental introduction of inconsistency.
