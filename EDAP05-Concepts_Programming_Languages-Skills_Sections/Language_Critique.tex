\section{Language Critique}\label{sec:Language_Critique}
The book provides a convenient common framework for arguing about the benefits and disadvantages of language features and programming languages in general.
Table 1.1 and, more generally, Section 1.3 in the book describe a number of axes along which we can try to understand the effect of language features and the qualities of programming languages.

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item You should be able to recognise and describe all the characteristics listed in Table 1.1, as well as the three basic criteria listed therein.
\item For some language feature, you should be able to recognise the characteristics and criteria affected by that feature's presence or absence.
\item For some language feature, you should be able to recognise how the feature's presence or absence affects the language, based on the three criteria from Table 1.1.
\item For two related language features, you should be able to compare them, based on the three criteria from Table 1.1.
\item For some language feature, you should be able to recognise and explain how it can affect the Cost considerations for training, compile time, execution time, and cost of poor reliability as outlined in Section 1.3.7.
\end{enumerate}
