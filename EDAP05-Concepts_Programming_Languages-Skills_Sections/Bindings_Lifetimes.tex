\section{Bindings and Lifetimes}\label{sec:Bindings_Lifetimes}

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item You should understand the difference between static and dynamic type binding and be able to take advantage of either property in your programming.
\item Given a syntax, a compiler and a run-time system for a language, you should be able to determine whether the language is using static or dynamic type binding.
\item Concepts: static binding, stack-dynamic binding, explicit heap-dynamic binding, and implicit heap-dynamic binding.
\item Given a syntax, a compiler and a run-time system for a language, you should be able to determine which storage binding(s) the language is using.
\item Concept: lifetime of a variable
\item Concepts: allocation and deallocation of a heap-dynamic variable
\item Concept: binding time, especially the difference between static and dynamic binding times
