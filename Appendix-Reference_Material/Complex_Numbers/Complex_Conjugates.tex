\subsection{Complex Conjugates}\label{app:Complex_Conjugates}
\begin{definition}[Complex Conjugate]\label{def:Complex_Conjugate}
  The conjugate of a complex number is called its \emph{complex conjugate}.
  The complex conjugate of a complex number is the number with an equal real part and an imaginary part equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.
  If we have a complex number as shown below,
  \begin{equation*}
    z = a \pm bi
  \end{equation*}

  then, the conjugate is denoted and calculated as shown below.
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Complex_Conjugates}
    \Conjugate{z} = a \mp bi
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}

The \nameref{def:Complex_Conjugate} can also be denoted with an asterisk ($*$).
This is generally done for complex functions, rather than single variables.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Complex_Conjugates_Asterisk}
  z^{*} = \Conjugate{z}
\end{equation}
