\subsection{Geometry of Complex Numbers}\label{subsec:Geometry_Complex_Numbers}
So far, we have viewed \nameref{def:Complex_Number}s only algebraically.
However, we can also view them geometrically as points on a 2 dimensional \nameref{def:Argand_Plane}.

\begin{definition}[Argand Plane]\label{def:Argand_Plane}
  An \emph{Argane Plane} is a standard two dimensional plane whose points are all elements of the complex numbers, $z \in \ComplexNumbers$.
  This is taken from Descarte's definition of a completely real plane.

  The Argand plane contains 2 lines that form the axes, that indicate the real component and the imaginary component of the complex number specified.
\end{definition}
