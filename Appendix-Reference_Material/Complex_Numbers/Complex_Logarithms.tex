\subsection{Complex Logarithms}\label{subsec:Complex_Logarithms}
There are some denotational changes that need to be made for this to work.
The traditional real-number natural logarithm $\ln$ needs to be redefined to its defining form $\log_{e}$.

With that denotational change, we can now use $\ln$ for the \nameref{def:Complex_Logarithm}.
