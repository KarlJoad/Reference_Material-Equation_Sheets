\section{Security Design}\label{sec:Security_Design}
\begin{questions}
\question{} Can you list four different principles upon which a security design should be based?
  \begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Use well-proven techniques, standards, libraries, hardware modules, and solutions.
    \item Keep system complexity as low as possible.
    \item Minimize the utilization of trusted components.
    \item Only develop your own solutions when really needed.
    \item Use open designs whenever possible.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{solution}

  \begin{parts}
  \part{} Give a motivation for each of the listed design principles
    \begin{solution}
      \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
      \item Well-proven solutions are constantly tested, so they have more verification of their security.
      \item By reducing the number of things that can go wrong, the system can be more secure.
        The reduced number of vulnerabilities means we can focus more on the ones that remain.
      \item The greater the reliance on trusted components, the more trust that must be placed in the hardware of the system.
      \item Developing novel and unique solutions requires a lot of design and engineering time. Additionally, if they are not well-designed, they can cause more problems than they solve.
      \item By using open designs, there is a lower risk of licensing issues.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{solution}
  \end{parts}

\question{} Describe the process steps to perform when going from a security architecture to a design specification.
  \begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Start with the Security Architecture.
    \item Map the desired security services to security standards.
    \item Identify gaps that are present in the System Design/Architecture.
      \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
      \item Complement the existing Security Design/Architecture with new Designs if needed.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Perform a \nameref{sec:Security_Evaluation}.
    \item Document the \nameref{sec:Security_Design}.
    \item Identify implementation efforts (missing hardware/software).
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{solution}

\question{} What is typically the role of unique identities in security systems?
  \begin{solution}
    To create a unique mapping from name to key, allowing for reliable authentication.
    This unique name can be used for discrete access control and authorization decisions in the system.
  \end{solution}

  \begin{parts}
  \part{} Give example of three different widely used identity types?
    \begin{solution}
      \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
      \item ITU
      \item IEEE's MAC Addresses
      \item IETF and URIs
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{solution}
  \end{parts}

\question{} What is the problem from privacy perspective with using fixed identities?
  \begin{solution}
    If the identity has been compromised (on the back-end), it can be traced back to a user/device.
  \end{solution}

  \begin{parts}
  \part{} Describe two different methods for avoiding the identity privacy problem in a system design
    \begin{solution}
      \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
      \item Randomly Generated Pseudonym.
        There is a middle-man that receives the unique identifier and assigns a random value to that, which is changed each time, and allows for identification of that user/device for that session.
      \item Encrypted Identity that is not visible outside trusted container boundaries.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{solution}
  \end{parts}

\question{} What is a digital certificate and how it is used?
  \begin{solution}
    A digital certificate is a way to securely distribute cryptographic keys while ensuring that they come from the correct person.
  \end{solution}

  \begin{parts}
  \part{} Which are the most important data fields in an X.509 certificate?
    \begin{solution}
      \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
      \item The algorithm used in the signature
      \item The Certificate Issuer's name
      \item The period of validity
      \item The Receipient's public key information
      \end{itemize}
    \end{solution}
  \end{parts}

\question{} Which is the most used authentication principle over HTTP?\@
  \begin{solution}
    The most common priniciple is the Challenge principle.
    The only way that the correct user can authenticate with the service is by solving a challenge only the real user should know.
  \end{solution}

  \begin{parts}
  \part{} Under which circumstances can basic authentication be used
  \part{} How are typically basic authentication treated at the server side and what is the main reason for using this type of storage?
  \part{} Describe the different steps in an HTTP basic authentication.
    \begin{solution}
      \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
      \item The client performs a \texttt{GET} request.
      \item The server responds with \texttt{Error 401: Unauthorized}, which asks the user to input information.
      \item The client returns their credentials.
      \item The server checks their credentials.
      \item The server either returns \texttt{Error 200: OK} or \texttt{Error 403: Forbidden}.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{solution}
