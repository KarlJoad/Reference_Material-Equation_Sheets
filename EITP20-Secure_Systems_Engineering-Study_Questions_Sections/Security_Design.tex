\section{Security Design}\label{sec:Security_Design}
\begin{questions}
\question{} Can you list four different principles upon which a security design should be based?
  \begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Use well-proven techniques, standards, libraries, hardware modules, and solutions.
    \item Keep system complexity as low as possible.
    \item Minimize the utilization of trusted components.
    \item Only develop your own solutions when really needed.
    \item Use open designs whenever possible.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{solution}

  \begin{parts}
  \part{} Give a motivation for each of the listed design principles
    \begin{solution}
      \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
      \item Well-proven solutions are constantly tested, so they have more verification of their security.
      \item By reducing the number of things that can go wrong, the system can be more secure.
        The reduced number of vulnerabilities means we can focus more on the ones that remain.
      \item The greater the reliance on trusted components, the more trust that must be placed in the hardware of the system.
      \item Developing novel and unique solutions requires a lot of design and engineering time. Additionally, if they are not well-designed, they can cause more problems than they solve.
      \item By using open designs, there is a lower risk of licensing issues.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{solution}
