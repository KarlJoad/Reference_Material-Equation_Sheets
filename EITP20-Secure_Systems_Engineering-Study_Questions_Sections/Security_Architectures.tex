\section{Security Architectures}\label{sec:Security_Architectures}
\begin{questions}
\question{} Describe what constitutes a security architecture and give some examples.
  \begin{solution}
    A Security Architecture has graphical and textual representations of a security system.
    It includes relations, trust levels, trust relationships, and interfaces between different parts of the system.
    It also has security and system boundaries to delimit different parts of the system that have various properties.
  \end{solution}

\question{} The Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture (SABSA) consist of 5 layers and one cross layer.
  \begin{parts}
  \part{} Describe the different layer views and list the names of the different layers.
    \begin{solution}
      \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
      \item Contextual Security Architecture is the view the business has of the system.
        It is quite similar to the Security Requirements.
      \item Conceptual Security Architecture is the highest-level view that an engineer can have of the system.
        This includes the general breakdown into secure portions of a system.
      \item Logical Security Architecture is the next level, that deals with data and its logical flows.
        Here, the way that data and its logical propagation are safeguarded is first developed.
      \item Physical Security Architecture is the 3rd design level.
        Here, the specific high-level security requirements and previous security architecture levels are combined to choose what needs to be done to secure the data.
      \item Component Security Architecture is the lowest level of the SABSA Security Architecture.
        Here, the actual protocols, standards, and hardware are chosen.
      \item Security Service Management Architecture is the ``cross layer''.
        It is concerned with how to maintain the system and its security.

\question{} A logical security architecture can be created using a six steps methodology:
  \begin{parts}
  \part{} Describe each of the different steps
    \begin{solution}
      \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
      \item Identify the main entities.
        Here, the users and the physical components in the system(s) are identified.
        Who is doing something and what is executing the user's actions?
      \item Identify the major functions in the system.
        Each computing entity has some function(s) that it needs to fulfill.
        What does each hardware entity need to do?
      \item Identify the security domains and their associations.
        Each entity and function exists within a security domain, i.e.\ how much they are trusted.
        In addition, how do these security domains interact with each other?
      \item Identify security services already meeting the Security Requirements.
        There may be some properties of the system that already meets the requirements as laid out in the Security Requirements.
        Identify these.
        There may also be security services that are required to meed the Security Requirements, identify these too.
      \item Map security services to the functional entities.
        Take the security services from the previous step, and match them together with the entities in the system.
      \item Create a graphical view of the logical architecture.
        It is easier to see how these security services get mapped to the entities and security domains if it is done in a graphical view and their interactions are shown.
        Each computing entity should be a box, each flow of communication an arrow, each user shown, and the computers/users should be grouped together into their security domains.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{solution}

  \part{} What is the end result?
    \begin{solution}
      A general logical view of the system to see what data needs to be secured and how that should be done.
      This will also specify the security services that should be used, the security domains, the users, the computing entities, among others.
    \end{solution}

  \part{} Give an example of a logical security architecture.
    \begin{solution}

    \end{solution}
  \end{parts}

\question{} What is a Physical Security Architecture?
  \begin{solution}
    A Physical Security Architecture is the general specification of how to implement the security given by the Logical Security Architecture.
    The expected outcome is a specification of the security solutions offered in the system, including the platform, software, and hardware security functions.
  \end{solution}

\question{} A physical security architecture when using the SABSA includes making a mapping to physical security mechanisms.
  \begin{parts}
  \part{} Describe what is meant by a ``Naming and Registration'' mechanism and give examples.
    \begin{solution}
      The Naming and Registration mechanism is concerned with how we identify the entities within our system.
      Additionally, when they have been given an identifier to recognize by, how we can register them with a system to ensure that when an entity claims to be something with a certain name, we can verify that.

      This typically includes:
      \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
      \item Unique Naming
        \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
        \item Using a common naming standard.

        \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{solution}

  \part{} Describe what is meant by a ``Storage and Runtime'' mechanism and give examples.
    \begin{solution}

      \item Data confidentiality
      \item Data integrity
      \item Software integrity

      \end{itemize}
    \end{solution}

  \part{} Describe what is meant by an ``Authentication and Session'' protection mechanism and give examples.
    \begin{solution}

    \end{solution}

  \part{} Describe what is meant by a ``User Interface and Naming'' mechanism and give examples.
    \begin{solution}
      Any time a user is interfacing with the system, that is a major vulnerability.
      The user has the ability to doanything they want there, and they may do something that compromises the security of the system.
      So, we need to minimize the number of actions a user can perform on a system to ensure they don't do something that harms the system.

      \end{itemize}
    \end{solution}

  \part{} Describe what is meant by a ``Monitoring and Incident'' mechanism and give examples.

  \end{parts}

\question{} What must in addition to the security mechanisms be specified in the physical security architecture?
  \begin{solution}
    The security of the network and the system's platforms must be considered as well.
  \end{solution}

\question{} Give examples of a platform security solution that can be used to build solutions meeting a logical security service and can be used to protect the chosen physical security mechanism?
  \begin{solution}
    If a logical security service requires secure, unique cryptographic keys be generated, then a platform security solution would be to use a Hardware Security Module to generate them.

    If a logical security service requires something be executed in a hardware-based secure execution environment, then the processor's built-in secure execution environment can be used.
  \end{solution}

\question{} For the SSO logical security architecture given at the lecture, perform the following:
  \begin{parts}
  \part{} Identify the main physical security mechanisms needed in the corresponding physical security architecture.
    \begin{solution}
      \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
      \item Each user must have a unique naming, likely drawn from their legal name.
      \item Each user must have a device(s) registered to them, which must be tracked.
      \item Each device will have keys to be able to use the system.
      \item The user has a password to be able to user the Single-Sign On service.
      \item The OIDC client must perform an authentication action on the user.
      \item The OIDC client must then confirm the authenticity of the user with the OIDC provider.
      \item This must them go to the Hosting Servers to perform the actual computation.
      \item Each of these servers must have replicas ready to take over.
      \item Each of these servers must also have data backups, in case of failure.
      \item They must be stored somewhere separate from the physical location of the user, likely close to the services that the SSO service provides.
      \item The physical security of this location must be tested.
      \item The UI for signing in should be as simple as possible.
      \item Once the user signs in, they should not have to do it again. If the system requires them to ``sign in'' again, then there needs to be a button for SSO.\@
      \item All login attempts should be logged, with user- and device-identifying information recorded too.
      \item There needs to be monitoring to ensure inappropriate IP addresses are banned (Users obviously not from your group).
      \end{itemize}
    \end{solution}

  \part{} Identify the main platform security components needed to fulfill the architecture
    \begin{solution}
      \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
      \item The system must have a user database somewhere.
      \item The user's passwords are only stored in their final hashed value.
      \item The servers and databases must have replicas for failover, and backups for complete failure.
      \item Any actions these servers take must be logged with entity-identifying information.
      \item Unlikely we need HSMs to generate keys, use built-in cryptographic functions on devices.
      \item Run the minimum of services required for functioning.
      \item The servers that run identification should likely run in a hardware-based secure execution environment.
      \item Each of these servers could be VMs as well, to allow for on-demand scaling and to prevent one issue from propagating.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{solution}
