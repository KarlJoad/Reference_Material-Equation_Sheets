\section{Security Architectures}\label{sec:Security_Architectures}
\begin{questions}
\question{} Describe what constitutes a security architecture and give some examples.
  \begin{solution}
    A Security Architecture has graphical and textual representations of a security system.
    It includes relations, trust levels, trust relationships, and interfaces between different parts of the system.
    It also has security and system boundaries to delimit different parts of the system that have various properties.
  \end{solution}

\question{} The Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture (SABSA) consist of 5 layers and one cross layer.
  \begin{parts}
  \part{} Describe the different layer views and list the names of the different layers.
    \begin{solution}
      \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
      \item Contextual Security Architecture is the view the business has of the system.
        It is quite similar to the Security Requirements.
      \item Conceptual Security Architecture is the highest-level view that an engineer can have of the system.
        This includes the general breakdown into secure portions of a system.
      \item Logical Security Architecture is the next level, that deals with data and its logical flows.
        Here, the way that data and its logical propagation are safeguarded is first developed.
      \item Physical Security Architecture is the 3rd design level.
        Here, the specific high-level security requirements and previous security architecture levels are combined to choose what needs to be done to secure the data.
      \item Component Security Architecture is the lowest level of the SABSA Security Architecture.
        Here, the actual protocols, standards, and hardware are chosen.
      \item Security Service Management Architecture is the ``cross layer''.
        It is concerned with how to maintain the system and its security.

\question{} A logical security architecture can be created using a six steps methodology:
  \begin{parts}
  \part{} Describe each of the different steps
    \begin{solution}
      \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
      \item Identify the main entities.
        Here, the users and the physical components in the system(s) are identified.
        Who is doing something and what is executing the user's actions?
      \item Identify the major functions in the system.
        Each computing entity has some function(s) that it needs to fulfill.
        What does each hardware entity need to do?
      \item Identify the security domains and their associations.
        Each entity and function exists within a security domain, i.e.\ how much they are trusted.
        In addition, how do these security domains interact with each other?
      \item Identify security services already meeting the Security Requirements.
        There may be some properties of the system that already meets the requirements as laid out in the Security Requirements.
        Identify these.
        There may also be security services that are required to meed the Security Requirements, identify these too.
      \item Map security services to the functional entities.
        Take the security services from the previous step, and match them together with the entities in the system.
      \item Create a graphical view of the logical architecture.
        It is easier to see how these security services get mapped to the entities and security domains if it is done in a graphical view and their interactions are shown.
        Each computing entity should be a box, each flow of communication an arrow, each user shown, and the computers/users should be grouped together into their security domains.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{solution}

  \part{} What is the end result?
    \begin{solution}
      A general logical view of the system to see what data needs to be secured and how that should be done.
      This will also specify the security services that should be used, the security domains, the users, the computing entities, among others.
    \end{solution}

  \part{} Give an example of a logical security architecture.

  \end{parts}

\question{} What is a Physical Security Architecture?
  \begin{solution}
    A Physical Security Architecture is the general specification of how to implement the security given by the Logical Security Architecture.
    The expected outcome is a specification of the security solutions offered in the system, including the platform, software, and hardware security functions.
  \end{solution}

    \end{solution}

  \part{} Describe what is meant by an ``Authentication and Session'' protection mechanism and give examples.
    \begin{solution}
      When a registered name wants to access our system, how do we ensure that they are who they say they are and make sure that they have not been compromised?
      \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
