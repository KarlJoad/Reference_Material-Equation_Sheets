\section{Security Architectures}\label{sec:Security_Architectures}
\begin{questions}
\question{} Describe what constitutes a security architecture and give some examples.
  \begin{solution}
    A Security Architecture has graphical and textual representations of a security system.
    It includes relations, trust levels, trust relationships, and interfaces between different parts of the system.
    It also has security and system boundaries to delimit different parts of the system that have various properties.
  \end{solution}

\question{} The Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture (SABSA) consist of 5 layers and one cross layer.
  \begin{parts}
  \part{} Describe the different layer views and list the names of the different layers.
  \part{} Give examples of questions the different SABSA architecture views are supposed to answer
    \begin{solution}
      \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
      \item Contextual Security Architecture is the view the business has of the system.
        It is quite similar to the Security Requirements.
      \item Conceptual Security Architecture is the highest-level view that an engineer can have of the system.
        This includes the general breakdown into secure portions of a system.
      \item Logical Security Architecture is the next level, that deals with data and its logical flows.
        Here, the way that data and its logical propagation are safeguarded is first developed.
      \item Physical Security Architecture is the 3rd design level.
        Here, the specific high-level security requirements and previous security architecture levels are combined to choose what needs to be done to secure the data.
      \item Component Security Architecture is the lowest level of the SABSA Security Architecture.
        Here, the actual protocols, standards, and hardware are chosen.
      \item Security Service Management Architecture is the ``cross layer''.
        It is concerned with how to maintain the system and its security.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{solution}
  \end{parts}

\item Which are the three different types of security services in a logical security architecture?
  \begin{parts}
  \part{} List and explain examples of services part of the non-prevention type of security services.
  \end{parts}

\item Describe each of the different prevention security services in more details.
  \begin{parts}
  \part{} Give example of at least four different entity security services and how they contribute to security prevention.
  \part{} Give example of at least four different communication security services and how they contribute to security prevention.
  \part{} Give example of at least four different application level security services and how they contribute to security prevention.
  \part{} Give example of at least four security management services and how they contribute to security prevention.
  \end{parts}

\item Draw a picture showing the relations between major different security services from a systems point of view.
\item A logical security architecture can be created using a six steps methodology:
  \begin{parts}
  \part{} Describe each of the different steps
  \part{} What is the end result?
  \part{} Give an example of a logical security architecture
  \end{parts}

\item What is a physical security architecture?
\item A physical security architecture when using the SABSA include making a mapping to physical security mechanisms
  \begin{parts}
  \part{} Describe what is meant by a ``Naming and registration'' mechanism and give examples
  \part{} Describe what is meant by a ``Storage and runtime'' mechanism and give examples
  \part{} Describe what is meant by a ``Physical security'' mechanism and give examples
  \part{} Describe what is meant by an ``Authentication and session'' protection mechanism and give examples
  \part{} Describe what is meant by a ``User interface and naming'' mechanism and give examples
  \part{} Describe what is meant by a ``Authorization and access control'' mechanism and give examples
  \part{} Describe what is meant by a ``Monitoring and incident'' mechanism and give examples
  \end{parts}

\item What must in addition to the security mechanisms be specified in the physical security architecture?
\item Give example of platform security solution that can be used to build solutions meeting a logical security services and can be used to protect the chosen physical security mechanism?
\item For the SSO logical security architecture given at the lecture, perform the following:
  \begin{parts}
  \part{} Identify the main physical security mechanisms needed in the corresponding physical security architecture.
  \part{} Identify the main platform security components needed to fulfil the architecture
    \begin{subparts}
    \subpart{} Suggest concrete platform security mechanisms to use for the physical realization.
    \end{subparts}
  \end{parts}
