\section{Design Process}\label{sec:Design_Process}
\begin{questions}
\question{} Which are the steps involved in the overall design process of a secure system?
  \begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Threat Analysis
    \item Security Requirements
    \item \nameref{sec:Security_Architectures}
    \item \nameref{sec:Security_Design}
    \item \nameref{sec:Security_Evaluation}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{solution}

  \begin{parts}
  \part{} Describe the relationship between the different steps?
    \begin{solution}
      In the Threat Analysis, the system is first scoped, to ensure that we limit our possibilities a little bit.
      Then, we attempt to find potential threats to the scoped system by performing one or more techniques (``Attacker can steal sensitive personal information.'').

      Once we find the potential threats, we use those along with any information/requirements given by the client to develop Security Requirements (``We require the use of encryption on personal data.'').

      The Security Architecture is the phase where we determine the kind of infrastructure we will need, the communication flows that are possible, find the interactions in the system, etc.
      This allows us to place our requirements onto the system as it exists already, and allow us to design for the system AND its longevity (``The personal info server is kept physically separate from others, only only communicates over mutually authenticated means using an appropriate cryptographic key.'').

      The Security Design is the process of actually choosing the standard, protocols, and hardware used to build the system (``The server will use keys generated by a Hardware Security Module, to ensure randomness.'').

      The Security Evaluation is done by going back to the Security Requirements and comparing the solutions you built in the Security Design and flows you developed in the Security Architecture to see if the requirements were satisfied.
      Other considerations can be put here too, including business ones (``Using a too difficult encryption algorithm will cause slowdowns of data requests/uses of the personal information.'').
    \end{solution}
  \end{parts}

\question{} In which way does a use-case description assist in the secure system design process?
  \begin{solution}
    It gives a general idea of \emph{how} the system will be used.
    This is important, because you can design a secure system in multiple ways to counter multiple threats.
    But, given the use-case of the client, there may be restrictions on what you can design for.
    It will help you derive the Security Requirements for the system, helping you Architect, Design, and Evaluate later in the process.
  \end{solution}

\question{} What is a threat analysis?
  \begin{solution}
    The process of finding potential threats to a system.
    These can be from inside the client's group, outside, or anywhere else.
    Using one or more methods, the applier can find current vulnerabilities, and future problems with the system.
    These are used after being given the use-case description, so that potential attack vectors can be limited to some extent.
  \end{solution}

\question{} What is the main purpose of performing a threat analysis?
  \begin{solution}
    It helps find the potential vulnerabilities in a system that \textbf{HAVE NOT} been found already.
    This will give a broader overview of the system, allowing for a more general, and hopefully, more all-encompassing secure system design.
  \end{solution}

\question{} Can you give examples of threat analysis approaches?
  \begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Schneier Attack Trees
    \item Microsoft's STRIDE Analysis
      \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
      \item Spoofing
      \item Tampering
      \item Repudiation
      \item Information Disclosure
      \item Denial of Service
      \item Elevation of Privilege
      \end{enumerate}
    \item MITRE's TARA Analysis
      \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
      \item Crown Jewel Analysis
      \item Cyber Risk Remediation Analysis
      \item Cyber Threat Susceptability Analysis
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{solution}

\question{} What is the purpose of a security requirements list?
  \begin{solution}
    To ensure that you (the secure system designer) and the stakeholders/clients/users of your system design can agree on what must be done.
    Agreement here will ensure the system is secure from both perspectives and that all parites are on the same page when it comes to the issue of security.
