\begin{definition}[Subtype Polymorphism]\label{def:Subtype_Polymorphism}
  \emph{Subtype polymorphism} can be summarized with the following phrase; ``This value has a \nameref{def:Data_Type}, and while you don't know what exact type it is, this \nameref{def:Data_Type} is a more restricted (or general) version of another \nameref{def:Data_Type} that you \textit{do} know, so therefore there are some things that you can do with it''.
