\section{Language vs. Language Implementation}\label{sec:Lang_vs_Lang_Implementation}
It is important that we make the distinction between a programming language and the programming language's implementation.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item A programming language and its implementation are completely separate things
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Technically, they are related, in that a programming language implementation is one way to fulfill the specifications that the programming language introduces
  \item You can implement a programming language in different ways. For example, C has these well-known implementations:
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item gcc
    \item LLVM/clang
    \item MSVC
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
