\subsection{\nameref*{def:Function_Side_Effect}s in Functional Languages}\label{subsec:Functional_Function_Side_Effects}
In a strict definition of \nameref{def:Functional_Programming_Language}s, \nameref{def:Function_Side_Effect}s are not allowed.
However, \nameref{def:Function_Side_Effect}s include:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Writing a file to disk
\item Sending packets over the network
\item Writing to standard output
\end{itemize}

However, if a functional language did not include these, the language is severely hampered in its usability.\footnote{Some functional languages are like this, but they are not widely used, so they are not discussed.}
To get ``around'' this issue, there are 3 ways functional languages can handle these non-pure actions.
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item The language was \emph{imperative first}.
  These are languages that:
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Were originally \nameref{def:Imperative_Programming_Language}s, like C, C++, Java
  \item Can be adapted to behave like functional languages if they are written correctly.
  \end{itemize}
\item The language was \emph{functional first}.
  These are languages that:
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Are by default true \nameref{def:Functional_Programming_Language}s, like Haskell, F\#, the ML-family
  \item Allow \nameref{def:Function_Side_Effect}s to be contained within the functions themselves, and not outside them.
  \item Has the compiler track these functions with \nameref{def:Function_Side_Effect}s so they are handled correctly.
  \end{itemize}
\item The language is \emph{monadic}.
  There is only a single language that supports this model right now, Haskell.
  A monad is:
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item An abstraction or generalization over ordered things
  \item These things may have side-effects, which are tagged.
  \item Monads allow for an imperative-like state to be introduced to a functional environment. However, the state exists \emph{ONLY} for the monad's function(s) and its/their children.
  \item Monads may also allow for state to be present throughout a program, but permission to access the state must be passed to functions, like an \nameref{def:Actual_Parameter}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Building Side Effects into a Language}\label{subsubsec:Building_Side_Effects_to_Language}
Since inference rules describe \nameref{def:Semantics} in a ``pure'' mathematical way, side effects become additional evaluation results.
This means our evaluation relation now relates the tuple $(expr, \text{previous state})$ with the tuple $(val, \text{state afterwards})$.

For example, to model printing, you could write
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Semantic_Side_Effect_Printing}
  \frac{(e, P) \EvaluatesTo (v, P')}{(\mathtt{PRINT\,} e, P) \EvaluatesTo (v, P'+[v])}
\end{equation}
\begin{description}[noitemsep]
\item $e$, The expression to be evaluated and printed.
\item $P$, The previous state of the system, in this case, the list of all previously printed numbers.
\item $v$, The value the expression $e$ evaluates to.
\item $P'$, The state of the system after printing, in this case, the list of all printed numbers up to this one.
\item $P'+[v]$, The list of printed numbers up to this point, with the value $v$ appended.
\end{description}

\begin{remark*}
  In \Cref{eq:Semantic_Side_Effect_Printing}, $\mathtt{PRINT} x$ would also return the evaluation result of $x$, so $\mathtt{PRINT} (\mathtt{PRINT} 7)$ would print the number 7 twice.
\end{remark*}
