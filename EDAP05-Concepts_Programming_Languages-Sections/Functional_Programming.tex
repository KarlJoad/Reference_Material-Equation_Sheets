\section{Functional Programming}\label{sec:Functional_Programming}
Recall the definition of a \nameref{def:Functional_Programming_Language}.
\defFunctionalProgrammingLanguage*{}

But, in short, these types of languages rely on the \emph{evaluation of expressions}, rather than the execution of commands.

\begin{large}
  \textbf{In this section, the functional language used is Standard ML.}
\end{large}

\subsection{Standard ML}\label{subsec:Functional-Standard_ML}
\begin{definition}[Standard ML]\label{def:Standard_ML}
  \emph{Standard ML}, \emph{SML}, \emph{Standard Meta Language} is a general-purpose, modular, \nameref{def:Functional_Programming_Language} with compile-time type checking and type inference.
  It uses \nameref{def:Pass_By_Value} for its evaluation of \nameref{def:Actual_Parameter}s to functions.
\end{definition}

Computation in Standard ML consists of sequential evaluation of expressions.
Each expression has 3 characteristics:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item It may or may not have a \emph{\nameref{def:Data_Type}}.
\item It may or may not have a \emph{\nameref{def:Variable_Value}}.
\item It may or may not have an \emph{effect}. These include:
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Raising an exception
  \item Modifying memory
  \item Performing I/O
  \item Sending a message on a network
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Every expression is \textbf{required} to have at least one \nameref{def:Data_Type}, making them \emph{well-typed}.
If an expression does \textbf{not} have a \nameref{def:Data_Type}, it is called \emph{ill-typed}, and cannot be evaluated.
The \emph{type checker} is in charge of checking the types of all expressions.

Well-typed expressions can be evaluated to determine their value.
This evaluation can be interrupted by an exception and/or a run-time fault.

\begin{definition}[Soundness]\label{def:Functional_Lang-Soundness}
  The \emph{soundness} of the \nameref{def:Data_Type} system ensures the accuracy of predictions made by the type checker.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Type Checking}\label{subsubsec:Functional-SML-Type_Checking}
A type in \nameref{def:Standard_ML} requires 3 things:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item A \emph{name} for the type, for later uses.
\item The \emph{values} that the type can have.
\item The \emph{operations} that may be performed with this type.
\end{enumerate}
