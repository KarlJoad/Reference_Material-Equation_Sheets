\subsection{Referencing Environments}\label{subsec:Referencing_Environments}
\begin{definition}[Referencing Environment]\label{def:Referencing_Environment}
  The \emph{referencing environment} of a statement is the collection of all \nameref{def:Variable}s that are visible in the statement.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{\nameref*{subsec:Referencing_Environments} in Languages with \nameref*{subsubsec:Static_Scope}}\label{subsubsec:Static_Scope_Referencing_Environment}
In a language that uses \nameref{subsubsec:Static_Scope}ing, the referencing environment includes all \nameref{def:Local_Variable}s in its \nameref{def:Variable_Scope} and all \nameref{def:Variable}s in the \nameref{def:Variable_Static_Ancestor} scopes that are \nameref{def:Visible_Variable}.
This also includes all function definitions and \nameref{def:Global_Variable}s up to that point.

The code block below and \Cref{tab:Static_Scope_Referencing_Environment-Execution} illustrate how a \nameref{def:Referencing_Environment} behave in a language that uses \nameref{def:Static_Scoping}.

\begin{minted}[frame=lines,linenos]{python3}
g = 3  # A global variable
def sub1():
    a = 5  # Create a local variable
    b = 7  # Create another local variable
    ...    # EXECUTION POINT 1
    def sub2():
        global g  # The global variable g is assignable here now
        c = 9 # Create a new local variable
        ...  # EXECUTION POINT 2
        def sub3():
            nonlocal c:  # Makes the nonlocal variable "c" visible here
            g = 11;
            ...  # EXECUTION POINT 3
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{\nameref*{subsec:Referencing_Environments} in Languages with \nameref*{subsubsec:Dynamic_Scope}}\label{subsubsec:Dynamic_Scope_Referencing_Environment}
In a language that uses \nameref{subsubsec:Dynamic_Scope}ing, the referencing environment includes all the \nameref{def:Local_Variable}s, the \nameref{def:Variable}s of all other \nameref{def:Subprogram_Active} subprograms, and the subprogram names.
This means that some \nameref{def:Variable}s in \nameref{def:Subprogram_Active} subprograms can be hidden from the referencing environment.

The code block below and \Cref{tab:Dynamic_Scope_Referencing_Environment-Execution} illustrate how a \nameref{def:Referencing_Environment} behave in a language that uses \nameref{def:Dynamic_Scoping}.

\begin{minted}[frame=lines,linenos]{c++}
void sub1() {
  int a, b;
  ...       // EXECUTION POINT 1
}
void sub2() {
  int b, c;
  ...       // EXECUTION POINT 2
  sub1();
}
void main() {
  int c, d;
  ...       // EXECUTION POINT 3
  sub2();
}
\end{minted}

                    & \texttt{c} of \texttt{main} is hidden by \texttt{sub2} and \texttt{b} of \texttt{sub2} hidden by \texttt{sub1} \\
    2 & \texttt{b} and \texttt{c} of \texttt{sub2}, \texttt{d} of \texttt{main} \\
                    & \texttt{c} of \texttt{main} is hidden by \texttt{sub2} \\
