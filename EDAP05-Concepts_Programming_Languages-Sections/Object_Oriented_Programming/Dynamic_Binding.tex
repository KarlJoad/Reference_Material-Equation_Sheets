\subsection{Dynamic Binding}\label{subsec:OOP_Dynamic_Binding}
\begin{definition}[Dynamic Dispatch]\label{def:OOP_Dynamic_Dispatch}
  \emph{Dynamic dispatch} is a way to dynamically bind \nameref{def:OOP_Message}s to \nameref{def:OOP_Method} definitions.

  An example of \nameref{def:OOP_Dynamic_Dispatch} is shown below.
\inputminted[frame=lines,linenos]{java}{./EDAP05-Concepts_Programming_Languages-Sections/Object_Oriented_Programming/Code/Dynamic_Dispatch.java}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Polymorphic]\label{def:OOP_Polymorphic}
  The reference to a \nameref{def:OOP_Subclass} is \emph{polymorphic} if it could also point to something in the \nameref{def:OOP_Superclass}.
  Thus, during runtime, the correct reference must be resolved through polymorphism and executed through \nameref{def:OOP_Dynamic_Dispatch}.

  For example, in Java
  \inputminted[frame=lines,linenos]{java}{./EDAP05-Concepts_Programming_Languages-Sections/Object_Oriented_Programming/Code/Polymorphism.java}
\end{definition}

In some cases, a \nameref{def:OOP_Class} sit so high in the hierarchy that it is never instantiated to an \nameref{def:OOP_Object}.
In that case, its functionality can be stripped out, and the \nameref{def:OOP_Class} can turn into an \nameref{def:OOP_Abstract_Class}, with \nameref{def:OOP_Abstract_Method}s.

\begin{definition}[Abstract \nameref*{def:OOP_Method}]\label{def:OOP_Abstract_Method}
  An \emph{abstract \nameref{def:OOP_Method}} (pure virtual \nameref{def:OOP_Method} in C++) is a \nameref{def:OOP_Method} that is missing its body.
  However, because the \nameref{def:OOP_Method} definition is still present, all \nameref{def:OOP_Subclass}es \textbf{are required} to implement the body/functionality of the abstract \nameref{def:OOP_Method}, turning it into a concrete \nameref{def:OOP_Method}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Abstract \nameref*{def:OOP_Class}]\label{def:OOP_Abstract_Class}
  An \emph{abstract \nameref{def:OOP_Class}} (abstract base \nameref{def:OOP_Class} in C++) is a \nameref{def:OOP_Class} that contains one or more \nameref{def:OOP_Abstract_Method}s.
  \textbf{These usually cannot be instantiated}.
  
  Any \nameref{def:OOP_Subclass} of an abstract class must provide implementations of all the inherited \nameref{def:OOP_Abstract_Method}s.
\end{definition}
