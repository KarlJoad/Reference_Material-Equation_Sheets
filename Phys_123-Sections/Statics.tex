\begin{definition}[Statics]\label{def:Statics}
  \emph{Statics} is the case when an object is at rest.
  It is when the sum of all forces in $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes is equal to 0.

  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep, nolistsep]
    \item \nameref{def:1-D Acceleration} is 0, which means $\vec{F}_{\text{Net}} = \vec{0}$. This means that there is no linear motion.
    \item \nameref{def:Angular Acceleration} is 0, which means $\vec{\tau}_{\text{Net}} = \vec{0}$. This means that there is no rotational motion.
    \item The Center of Gravity is the \nameref{def:Center of Mass}.
  \end{itemize}

  To solve any \nameref{sec:Statics} problem, you simply have to solve for \Cref{eq:Statics}.
  The net force and net \nameref{def:Torque} both must sum to 0.

  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Statics}
    \begin{aligned}
      \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \vec{F}_{i} &= \vec{0} \\
      \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \vec{\tau}_{i} &= \vec{0}
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
