\section{Newton's Laws} \label{sec:Newtons Laws}
There are 3 fundamental laws of classical mechanics.

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, nolistsep]
  \item An object in motion/at reast stays as such, unless acted upon by an outide force(s).
  \item Force is equal to the change in momentum ($p=mv$) per change in time. For a constant mass, force equals mass times acceleration ($\vec{F} = m \vec{a}$).
  \item For every force there is an equal and opposite force.
\end{enumerate}
