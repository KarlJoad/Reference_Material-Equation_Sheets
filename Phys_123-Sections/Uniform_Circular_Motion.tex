\begin{definition}[Uniform Circular Motion] \label{def:Uniform Circular Motion}
  \emph{Uniform circular motion} is when an object of moving in a perpetual circular motion.
  There is no outside source of acceleration changing the state of the system.
  \begin{remark}
    This does \emph{not} happen in real life.
    However, it is useful for modelling things under ideal conditions that do happen in real life.
