\section{Dynamics of Circular Motion}\label{sec:Dynamics Circular Motion}
There are three cases when the \nameref{sec:Dynamics Circular Motion} are easily visible.
Each of these is illustrated with an example.
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, nolistsep]
  \item Turning on a flat curve, neglecting friction (\Cref{ex:Car Turning on a Flat Curve})
  \item Turning on an angled curve, neglecting friction (\Cref{ex:Car Turning on Angled Curve with No Friction})
  \item Turning on an angled curve, with friction (\Cref{ex:Car Turning on Angled Curve with Friction})
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}[]{Car Turning on a Flat Curve}
  A car of mass $m$ is turning on a flat curve.
  What is its maximum velocity, $v_{\text{Max}}$?

\begin{example}[]{Car Turning on Angled Curve with No Friction}
  A car of mass $m$ is turning on a curve with an angle $\theta$ from the horizontal.
  What is its maximum velocity, $v_{\text{Max}}$?

\begin{example}[]{Car Turning on Angled Curve with Friction}
  A car of mass $m$ is turning on a curve with an angle $\theta$ from the horizontal.
  There is friction, with the coefficient of static friction being $\mu_{s}$ and coefficient of kinetic friction being $\mu_{k}$.
  What is its maximum velocity, $v_{\text{Max}}$?
