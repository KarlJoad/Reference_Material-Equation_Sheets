\section{Transistor Amplifiers}\label{sec:Transistor_Amps}
Now, we are going to apply \emph{both} AC and DC signals to a \nameref{def:Transistor}, and watch the outputs.
There is some important terminology to be aware of here:
\begin{description}
\item[DC] Uses all uppercase letters, such as $\DCVoltage{\Base}$ or $\DCCurrent{\Drain}$.
\item[AC] Uses all lowercase letters, such as $\ACVoltage{\Gate\Source}$ or $\ACCurrent{\Drain}$.
\item[Mixed] Uses lowercase letters, with capital subscripts, such as $\SignalVoltage{GS}$.
  These are typically defined as $\SignalVoltage{GS} = \ACVoltage{GS} + \DCVoltage{GS}$.
\end{description}
