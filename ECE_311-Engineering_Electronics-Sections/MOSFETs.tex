\section{MOS Field-Effect Transistors}\label{sec:MOSFETs}
In this section, we start studying \nameref{def:Transistor}s.

\begin{definition}[Transistor]\label{def:Transistor}
  A \emph{transistor} is a \nameref{def:Semiconductor} device used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power.
  Transistors are one of the basic building blocks of modern electronics.
  It is composed of semiconductor material usually with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit.
