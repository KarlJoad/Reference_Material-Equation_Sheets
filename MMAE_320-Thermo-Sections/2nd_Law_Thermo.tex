\section{The Second Law of Thermodynamics}\label{sec:2nd_Law_Thermo}
\begin{definition}[\nth{2} Law of Thermodynamics]\label{def:2nd_Law_Thermo}
  The \emph{\nth{2} law of thermodynamics} states that the total \nameref{def:Entropy} of an \nameref{def:Isolated_System} can \textbf{never} decrease over time, and is constant if and only if all \nameref{def:Process}es are reversible.
  Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy.

  In terms of total \nameref{def:Energy} in a system, this law states that the total energy of the system is minimized at all times during a \nameref{def:Process}.
