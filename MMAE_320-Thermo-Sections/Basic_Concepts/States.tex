\begin{definition}[State]\label{def:State}
  The \emph{state} of the system includes all properties that can be measured or calculated which can completely describe the condition of the system.
\end{definition}

In any given \nameref{def:State}, all the properties of a system will have fixed values.
If any single property changes, all the others will change in accordance.
We are typically interested in \nameref{def:Equilibrium} states.
