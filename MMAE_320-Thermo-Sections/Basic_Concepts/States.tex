\subsection{States}\label{subsec:States}
\begin{definition}[State]\label{def:State}
  The \emph{state} of the system includes all properties that can be measured or calculated which can completely describe the condition of the system.
\end{definition}

In any given \nameref{def:State}, all the properties of a system will have fixed values.
If any single property changes, all the others will change in accordance.
We are typically interested in \nameref{def:Equilibrium} states.

\begin{definition}[Equilibrium]\label{def:Equilibrium}
  \emph{Equilibrium} is a \nameref{def:State} of a \nameref{def:System} which does not change when isolated from it surroundings.
  A system will only leave equilibrium when disturbed by an outside \nameref{def:Energy}, or an unbalanced \nameref{def:Driving_Force}.
\end{definition}
