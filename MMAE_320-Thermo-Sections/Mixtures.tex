\section{Mixtures}\label{sec:Mixtures}
In the real world, we come across \nameref{def:Mixture}s all the time.
They do not have the same properties as their \nameref{def:Pure_Substance} counterparts.

\begin{definition}[Mixture]\label{def:Mixture}
  A \emph{mixture} is a substance or set of substances that contain at least more than one different \nameref{def:Saturated_Liquid} and \nameref{def:Saturated_Vapor} at a time.
