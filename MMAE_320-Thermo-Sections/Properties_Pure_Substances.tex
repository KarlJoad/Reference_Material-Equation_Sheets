\section{Properties of Pure Substances}\label{sec:Properties_Pure_Substances}
Many of the substances that we study in \nameref{def:Thermodynamics} are what we call \nameref{def:Pure_Substance}s.

\begin{definition}[Pure Substance]\label{def:Pure_Substance}
  A \emph{pure substance} is one whose chemical composition is fixed throughout.
  Properties of these substances are completely known, and these properties are completely uniform throughout the substance.
\end{definition}

In general, the pressure of a substance is an exponential function that is dependent on the temperature of the water.
In addition, the pressure of the substance depends on its altitude.
As you increase in altitude, this means that the temperature required to boil the substance at decreases.
All of these are visualized in \Cref{fig:Temp_Pressure_Liquid_Vapor_Curve}.

  \label{fig:Temp_Pressure_Liquid_Vapor_Curve}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Phase Changes}\label{subsec:Phase_Changes}
Phase changes in materials are unique, because they maintain a constant temperature \textbf{until} all the material undergoes the phase change, however, the volume increases \textbf{drastically}.

\begin{definition}[Phase Change]\label{def:Phase_Change}
  A \emph{phase change} in a substance is when it changes from one state of matter to another.
  This means a substance goes from solid to liquid, liquid to gas, gas to solid, solid to gas, etc.
  Each of these ``directions'' has a name:
  \begin{description}[noitemsep]
  \item[Solid to Liquid:] Melting/Fusion
  \item[Liquid to Solid:] Solidification/Crystallization
  \item[Liquid to Gas:] Evaporation/Vaporization
  \item[Gas to Liquid:] Condensation
  \item[Solid to Gas:] Sublimation
  \item[Gas to Solid:] Desposition
  \end{description}
\end{definition}

This is visualized as the line between points $A$ and $B$ on the graph in \Cref{fig:Phase_Change}.

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{./Phase_Change_Graph.png}
  \caption{Phase Change Graph}
  \label{fig:Phase_Change}
\end{figure}

The line drawn in \Cref{fig:Phase_Change} assumes that the material undergoing the phase change is under \nameref{def:Isobaric} conditions, meaning the pressure is \textbf{not} changing.
However, different pressures (under their own \nameref{def:Isobaric} conditions) will yield different, but similarly shaped, lines as well.

\begin{remark*}
  \Cref{fig:Phase_Change} is also \textbf{NOT} drawn to proportion, as the angle on the first portion of the line is typically \textbf{very} sharp.
  Obviously, \Cref{fig:Phase_Change} is an idealized graph for the temperature-volume graph of a substance and its respective phase change.
  Even though the graph is idealized, it is fine for our needs, and for most needs in \nameref{def:Thermodynamics}.
\end{remark*}

There are several notable points on the graph in \Cref{fig:Phase_Change}:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item Between the origin and point $A$, the substance is called a \nameref{def:Compressed_Liquid}.
  Table A.7 in the textbook has data points for some materials in this state, but the actual values vary very little.
\item At point $A$, the solid begins to boil, becoming a \nameref{def:Saturated_Liquid}, and is denoted $\Fluid{\SpecificVolume}$.
\item Between points $A$ and $B$, the substance is called a \nameref{def:Saturated_Mixture}.
  Here, there are parts of the substance in the liquid phase and the other parts of the substance are in the vapor phase.
  In the textbook, Tables A.4 and A.5 are used here.
\item At point $C$, we have a \nameref{def:Saturated_Vapor} and is denoted $\Vapor{\SpecificVolume}$.
  In the textbook, Tables A.4 and A.5 are used here.
\item Beyond point $C$, the substance is a \nameref{def:Superheated_Vapor}.
  Table A.6 is used in the textbook for substances in this state.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{definition}[Compressed Liquid]\label{def:Compressed_Liquid}
  A \emph{compressed liquid} is a substance, in its liquid state, as it is being heated and gaining volume, until right before it starts to boil.
  Table A.7 in the textbook has data points for some materials in this state, but the actual values vary very little.
  This is because \nameref{def:Pressure} does not change volume much.
  However, temperature \textbf{does} change the volume, therefore, treat compressed liquids as \nameref{def:Saturated_Liquid} at temperature $\Temp$, so use Table A.4.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Saturated Liquid]\label{def:Saturated_Liquid}
  A \emph{saturated liquid} is a substance, starting its \nameref{def:Phase_Change} state between liquid and gas.
  The \nameref{def:Specific_Volume} where a \nameref{def:Compressed_Liquid} begins to boil is denoted $\Fluid{\SpecificVolume}$.
  Tables A.4, and A.5 in the textbook are used here.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Saturated Mixture]\label{def:Saturated_Mixture}
  A \emph{saturated mixture} is a substance in the middle of its \nameref{def:Phase_Change} state betwen a liquid and a gas.
  Parts of the substance in the liquid phase and the other parts of the substance are in the vapor phase.
  In the textbook, Tables A.4 and A.5 are used here.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Saturated Vapor]\label{def:Saturated_Vapor}
  A \emph{saturated vapor} is a substance that has \textbf{JUST} completely undergone its \nameref{def:Phase_Change} to fully become a gas.
  The \nameref{def:Specific_Volume} where this occurs is denoted $\Vapor{\SpecificVolume}$.
  Table A.6 in the textbook contains data points for these vapors.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Superheated Vapor]\label{def:Superheated_Vapor}
  A \emph{superheated vapor} is a substance that has undergone a complete \nameref{def:Phase_Change} to become a gas.
  Here, even if heat is removed, the substance remains a gas until it cools enough or increases in pressure enough to become a \nameref{def:Saturated_Vapor}, then a \nameref{def:Saturated_Mixture} again.
  Table A.6 in the textbook is used to find values for substances in this state.
\end{definition}

\Cref{fig:Phase_Change} can be overlayed with a curve that intersets the different isobars of that \nameref{def:Pure_Substance} based on their \nameref{def:Saturated_Liquid} and \nameref{def:Saturated_Vapor} points.

\begin{definition}[Interpolate]\label{def:Interpolate}
  Many of the values in the tables in the textbook are useful.
  However, sometimes the value we are interested in is \textit{not} in these tables, but between some known entries in the table.
  So, we must \emph{interpolate} a result to use.
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Interpolate}
    y = y_{0} + (x_{1} - x) \left( \frac{y_{1} - y_{0}}{x_{1} - x_{0}} \right)
  \end{equation}
  \begin{description}[noitemsep]
  \item[$y$] The value we intend to interpolate for.
  \item[$y_{0}$] The ``earlier'' value to use.
    Typically, this is the known data point below our value of interest.
  \item[$y_{1}$] The ``later'' value to use.
    Typically, this is the known data point above our value of interest.
  \item[$x$] The independent value that we are interested in interpolating \textit{at}.
  \item[$x_{0}$] The ``earlier'' value to use.
    Typically, this is the known data point below our value of interest.
  \item[$x_{1}$] The ``later'' value to use.
    Typically, this is the known data point above our value of interest.
  \end{description}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}{Properties of Water}
  Given water at temperature $\Temp = \SI{75}{\degreeCelsius}$ and a pressure $\Pressure = \SI{100}{\kilo\pascal}$.
  What is the water's current state?
  \tcblower{}
  We can start by looking in Table A.4 in the textbook.

  At \SI{75}{\degreeCelsius}, water boils at \SI{38}{\kilo\pascal}.
  This water will \textbf{not} boil at that temperature and pressure.
  Now going to Table A.5, which says that at our pressure, water boils at \SI{99.61}{\degreeCelsius}.

  This means that the water is in its liquid state, and is not in its \nameref{def:Saturated_Mixture} state yet.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[Enthalpy of Vaporization]\label{def:Enthalpy_Vaporization}
  The \emph{\nameref{def:Specific_Enthalpy} of vaporization} (or \emph{latent heat of vaporization}) represents the amount of \nameref{def:Energy} required to vaporize a unit mass of \nameref{def:Saturated_Liquid} at a given temperature or pressure.
  This value \textbf{decreases} as the temperature and/or pressure increase and becomes $0$ at the critical point.
  This value is denoted using $\SpecificEnthalpy_{fg}$, and is composed using \Cref{eq:Enthalpy_Vaporization} below.
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Enthalpy_Vaporization}
    \SpecificEnthalpy_{fg} = \SpecificEnthalpy_{f} - \SpecificEnthalpy_{g}
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
