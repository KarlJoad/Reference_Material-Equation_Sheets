\section{Properties of Pure Substances}\label{sec:Properties_Pure_Substances}
Many of the substances that we study in \nameref{def:Thermodynamics} are what we call \nameref{def:Pure_Substance}s.

\begin{definition}[Pure Substance]\label{def:Pure_Substance}
  A \emph{pure substance} is one whose chemical composition is fixed throughout.
  Properties of these substances are completely known, and these properties are completely uniform throughout the substance.
