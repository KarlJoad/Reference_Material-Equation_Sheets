\subsection{Curried Function Types}\label{subsec:Curried_Function_Types}
\nameref{def:Function}s with multiple arguments can be handled differently, if we are allowed to Curry functions and use \nameref{def:Higher_Order_Function}s.
If we can use those, then we can have a function take a function as an argument as return a function as a result.
So, instead of making \texttt{add} take 2 integers at once, we could instead give it just one, and that function will return another that adds the given value to the previously provided one.
An example is shown in \Cref{lst:Curried_Add_Example}
