\subsection{List Types}\label{subsec:List_Types}
\begin{definition}[List]\label{def:List}
  In Haskell, a \emph{list} is a sequence of elements that are \textbf{all the same \nameref{def:Type}}.
  The elements are enclosed within brackets, \texttt{[} and \texttt{]}, with each element separated by commas.

  \Cref{lst:List_Examples} shows examples of lists and their synatax.
\end{definition}

Below are some examples of lists.

The number of elements in a list is its length, where the empty list has length zero and does not contain any elements.
The empty list is unique in that it can also be considered an element for other lists, allowing for the construction of lists using the \texttt{cons} operator \haskellinline{:}.
