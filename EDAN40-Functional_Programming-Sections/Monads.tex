\section{Monads}\label{sec:Monads}
So far, we have only written Haskell programs as \nameref{def:Batch_Program}s.
However, most people today like \nameref{def:Interactive_Program}s.

\begin{definition}[Batch Program]\label{def:Batch_Program}
  A \emph{batch program} is a program that takes some input from the user at the beginning of program execution and returns some result afterwards.
  During the computations, there is no further interaction between user and program.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Monad]\label{def:Monad}
  \emph{Monads} are fairly unique to Haskell.
\end{definition}
