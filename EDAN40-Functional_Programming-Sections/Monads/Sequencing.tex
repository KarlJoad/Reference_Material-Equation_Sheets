\subsection{Sequencing}\label{subsec:Sequencing}
The natural way of combining two actions is to perform one after the other in sequence, with the modified world returned by the first action becoming the current world for the second, by means of a sequencing operator, read as ``then''.
It is defined in \Cref{lst:Then_Operator_Definition}.

\begin{listing}[h!tbp]
\begin{haskellsource}
(>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
f >>= g = \world -> case f world of
                         (v, world') -> g v world'
\end{haskellsource}
\caption{\haskellinline{>>=} Operator Definition}
\label{lst:Then_Operator_Definition}
\end{listing}

In words, we apply the action \texttt{f} to the current world, then apply the function \texttt{g} to the result value and the modified world as a second action, yielding the final result.

Using the \texttt{do}-notation allows us to use the ``then'' or ``bind'' operator without having to type it in that fashion.
In addition, \texttt{do}-notation is syntactic sugar for a special case of a \texttt{where} block.
An example of using \texttt{do}-notation is shown in \Cref{lst:Do_Notation_Example}.

\begin{listing}[h!tbp]
\begin{haskellsource}
getChar :: IO Char
getChar = do x <- getCh -- Gets character from KBD without echoing to screen
             putChar x
             return x
\end{haskellsource}
