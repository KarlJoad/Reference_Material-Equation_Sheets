\subsection{Termination}\label{subsec:Termination}
Throughout this section, we will use a recursive definition that yields a value similar to infinity.
\haskellsourcefile{./EDAN40-Functional_Programming-Sections/Lazy_Evaluation/Code/infty.hs}

In practice, trying to evaluate \texttt{infty} will quickly exhaust the available memory and produce an error message.
Consider the expression \haskellinline{fst (0, inf)}, where \texttt{fst} is the library function that selects the first component of a pair, defined by \haskellinline{fst (x, y) = x}.

Call-by-value evaluation with this expression also results in non-termination.
