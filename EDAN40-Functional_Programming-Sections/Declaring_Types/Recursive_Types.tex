\subsection{Recursive Types}\label{subsec:Recursive_Types}
Some \nameref{def:Type}s lend themselves to being self-recursive.
As we saw earlier, we cannot use the \haskellinline{type} keyword to construct these.
Instead, we must use the \haskellinline{data} keyword to build new \nameref{def:Type}s that \textbf{are} self-recursive.
