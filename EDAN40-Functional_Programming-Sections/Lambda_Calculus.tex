\section{Lambda Calculus}\label{sec:Lambda_Calculus}
\nameref{def:Lambda_Calculus} is the basis of functional programming and all the languages that express it.
The first programming language to use \nameref{def:Lambda_Calculus}, and thus be a \nameref{def:Functional_Programming_Language}, was \textsc{lisp} in the 1960s.

\begin{definition}[Lambda Calculus]\label{def:Lambda_Calculus}
  \emph{Lambda Calculus} (\emph{$\lambda$-calculus}) is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.
  It is a universal model of computation that can be used to simulate any Turing machine.
  It was introduced by the mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of his research into the foundations of mathematics.
