\section{Lazy Evaluation}\label{sec:Lazy_Evaluation}
So far, the basic method of computation in Haskell has been the application of \nameref{def:Function}s to arguments.
Because these functions are pure, changing the order in which functions are applied does not affect the final result.
This is not specific to simple examples, but an important general property of function application in Haskell.
Formally, in Haskell any two different ways of evaluating the same expression will always produce the same final value, provided that they both terminate.
