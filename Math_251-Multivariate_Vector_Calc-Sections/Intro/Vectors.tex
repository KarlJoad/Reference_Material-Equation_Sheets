\begin{definition}[Vector]\label{def:Vector}
  A \emph{vector} in mathematics behaves identically to the way it behaves in science and engineering, i.e.\ a vector is a quantity with \textbf{both} a direction and a magnitude.

  However, we have a slightly more mathematical definition we can leverage as well, given below.
  A vector is an ordered list of $n$ numbers, typically denoted $\langle x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n} \rangle$.
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Vector}
    v \in \RealNumbers^{n} = \langle x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n} \rangle
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}

There are several vectors that are special:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item $\vec{0}$, the \nameref{def:Zero_Vector}.
\item $\ihat$, one of the \nameref{def:Unit_Vector}s, with value $\langle 1, 0, 0 \rangle$.
\item $\jhat$, one of the \nameref{def:Unit_Vector}s, with value $\langle 0, 1, 0 \rangle$.
\item $\khat$, one of the \nameref{def:Unit_Vector}s, with value $\langle 0, 0, 1 \rangle$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{definition}[Zero Vector]\label{def:Zero_Vector}
  The \emph{zero vector} is a special vector that has a magnitude of zero and is directionless.
  It is the only vector that has both of these characteristics.
  The zero vector is defined as:
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Zero_Vector}
    \vec{0} = \langle 0, 0, 0 \rangle
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
