\begin{definition}[Vector]\label{def:Vector}
  A \emph{vector} in mathematics behaves identically to the way it behaves in science and engineering, i.e.\ a vector is a quantity with \textbf{both} a direction and a magnitude.

  However, we have a slightly more mathematical definition we can leverage as well, given below.
  A vector is an ordered list of $n$ numbers, typically denoted $\langle x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n} \rangle$.
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Vector}
    v \in \RealNumbers^{n} = \langle x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n} \rangle
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
