\subsection{Transposing a System}\label{subsec:Filter_Implementation-Transposing_System}
To transpose any system's block diagram, you need to follow these steps.
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item Reverse the direction of each interconnection
\item Reverse direction of each multiplier
\item Change junctions to adders and adders to junctions
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Adders become junctions
  \item Junctions become adders
  \end{itemize}
\item Interchange the input and output
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Numerical Precision Issues}\label{subsec:Filter_Implementation-Numerical_Precision_Issues}
The main issues here are:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item Our coefficients, $\alpha$, $\beta$, etc.\ are stored in hardware with finite precision, if not a power of 2.
\item Arithmetic is done with finite precision
\end{enumerate}

To deal with this, use typically say ``Our system is perfect, and the above issues are just noise in the system.''
These imprecisions cause \textbf{\emph{\large{HUGE}}} issues.
Wilkinson's Polynomial illustrates this.

The solution to these issues is to not implement the filter's whole $H(z)$ at once.
Instead, we create a cascade of smaller filters with \nameref{def:Biquad}s.
You implement a cascade of \nameref{def:Biquad} filters until you have achieved the $H(z)$ that you desire.

\begin{definition}[Biquad]\label{def:Biquad}
  A \emph{biquad} filter is one that has only 2 poles and 2 zeros.
\end{definition}

You pick the setup of the cascade in the following order:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item Find the optimal pole-zero combinations
  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item Plot the magnitude response
  \item Choose the \nameref{def:Biquad} that minimizes noise and maximizes the signal frequency desired
  \end{enumerate}
\item Find the optimal arrangement of cascaded filter \nameref{def:Biquad}s
  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item Minimize the average output power of the noise signal
  \item This means the filter with the lowest output power is \textbf{LAST} in the cascade.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
