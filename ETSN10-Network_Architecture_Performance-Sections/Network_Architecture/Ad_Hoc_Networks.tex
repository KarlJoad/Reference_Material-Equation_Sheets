\begin{definition}[Ad-Hoc Network]\label{def:Ad_Hoc_Network}
  An \emph{ad-hoc network} is a network that does not rely on \textbf{ANY} fixed infrastructure.
  Many ad-hoc networks tend to have similar properties.
  \begin{propertylist}
  \item Often unplanned: They need to be
    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Self-configuring
    \item Self-organizing
    \item Self-healing
    \end{enumerate}

  \item The network topology can be highly dynamic because of high \nameref{def:Mobility} or unreliable links.
  \item The network usually has a flat architecture, where most nodes are peers, with few if any gateways/base stations.
  \item The most important performance goal is \textbf{low-energy usage}.
  \end{propertylist}

  This also means that these networks tend to be highly delay-tolerant, with next to no requirements on latency, or data transmission rate.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Uses of Ad-Hoc Networks}\label{subsubsec:Uses_Ad_Hoc_Network}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Disaster recovery, rescue services
\item Developing areas where there is a lack of infrastructure
\item Personal area networks (e.g. Bluetooth)
\item Wireless sensor networks: monitoring and data gathering, especially in inaccessible or remote areas
\item Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs): where vehicles communicate wirelessly
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Example Ad-Hoc Architectures}\label{subsubsec:Ad_Hoc_Architectures}
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item 802.11p
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item WiFi for vehicular networks
  \item 5 Ghz band, range \textasciitilde{} 500 m
  \item MAC:\@ 802.11 DCF
  \item Ad-hoc mode: no access points, no association
  \item Beacons sent every 100 ms with vehicle location, speed, etc.
  \end{itemize}

\item Z-Wave
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Mainly used for smart homes
  \item 800 MHz band, range: \textasciitilde{} 100 m
  \item MAC:\@ CSMA/CA
  \end{itemize}
