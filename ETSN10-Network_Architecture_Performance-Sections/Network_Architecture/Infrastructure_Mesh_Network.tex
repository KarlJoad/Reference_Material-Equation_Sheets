\begin{definition}[Wireless Mesh Network]\label{def:Wireless_Mesh_Network}
  A \emph{wireless mesh network} (\emph{WMN}) is a network where there are multiple wireless hops between nodeswho are all peers, meaning there is little to no hierarchy.
  There may be some hierarchy, if only some nodes are the ones with the direct Internet connection.
\end{definition}

These architectures use many nodes who communicate with each other to move data from anywhere in the network to a select number of nodes that contain the actual Internet connection.
This may require several hops until we reach a node with a connection.
Throughout this process, we do not have to worry about nodes moving, because they are fixed.
However, we still need to maintain the routing information, so the packets are sent back to the correct node.
