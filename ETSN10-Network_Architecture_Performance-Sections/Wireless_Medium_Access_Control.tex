\section{Wireless Medium Access Control}\label{sec:Wireless_MAC}
We need to separate when devices are transmitting.
Due to the nature of radio waves, we cannot transmit simultaneously on the same frequency from multiple devices.

\subsection{Reservation Schemes}\label{subsec:Reservation_Scheme}
To begin our discussion of \nameref{def:Reservation_Scheme}s, we must talk about \nameref{def:ALOHA}.

\begin{definition}[ALOHA]\label{def:ALOHA}
  \emph{ALOHA} was one of the earliest protocols for wireless data transmission.
  It used a purely random access scheme, so when you had a packet to send, it was sent.
  To ensure devices knew if their transmission was successful, an acknoledgement was sent when the next recipient in the chain received the message.

  \begin{remark}
    It is only mentioned here because it is used as a baseline measurement for other protocols.
  \end{remark}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Reservation Scheme]\label{def:Reservation_Scheme}
  A \emph{reservation scheme} is the idea of reserving resources for a node in a wireless network to prevent collisions.
  The resources that can be reserved include: time, frequency, and others.

  We would like to reserve resources because the system will not lose capacity to collisions.
  But, if not \textbf{all} the resources are being fully utilized, then the system loses out on throughput.

  Because of the limitations of the radio spectrum and light being a broadcast medium, we have 4 main solutions for supporting multiple devices that was to transmit.
  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item \nameref{def:SDMA}
  \item \nameref{def:FDMA}
  \item \nameref{def:TDMA}
  \item \nameref{def:CDMA}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

    \midrule
    Idea & Segment space into cells/sectors & Segment sending time into mutually disjoint time-slots, demand-driven or pattern-driven. & Segment the frequency band into disjoing sub-bands. & Spread the spectrum according to orthogonal codes. \\ \midrule
    Terminals & One one terminal can be active in a single cell/sector. & All terminals active for short time periods on the same frequency. & Every terminal has its own frequency, uninterrupted. & All terminals can be active at the same time at the same place, on the same frequency. \\ \midrule
    Signal Separation & Cell structure, directed antennas. & Synchronization in time domain. & Filtering in frequency domain. & Code plus special receivers. \\ \midrule
    Advantages & Very simple, increases capacity per unit area. & Established, \textbf{fully digital}, flexible. & Simple, established, robust. & Flexible, less frequency planning needed, soft handover. \\ \midrule
    Disadvantages & Inflexible, antennas typically fixed. & Guard time needed (multipath propagation), synchronization difficult. & Inflexible, frequencies are a scarce resource and must be decided from beginning. & Complex receivers, needs more complicated power management from senders. \\ \midrule
    Comments & Only useful in combination with \nameref{subsubsec:TDMA}, \nameref{subsubsec:FDMA}, or \nameref{subsubsec:CDMA}. & Standard in fixed networks. Used together with \nameref{subsubsec:FDMA} and \nameref{subsubsec:SDMA} in mobile networks. & Typically combined with \nameref{subsubsec:TDMA} (frequency hopping patterns) and \nameref{subsubsec:SDMA} (frequency reuse) & Has some problems still. Higher complexity, lower expectations. Needs integration with \nameref{subsubsec:TDMA}/\nameref{subsubsec:FDMA}. \\

\subsubsection{SDMA}\label{subsubsec:SDMA}
\begin{definition}[Space Division Multiple Access]\label{def:SDMA}
  In a \emph{space division multiple access} (\emph{SDMA}) setup, the space is segmented into sectors, then addressed with directed antennas.
  These tend to follow a distinct cell structure to handle varying number of people.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{FDMA}\label{subsubsec:FDMA}
\begin{definition}[Frequency Division Multiple Access]\label{def:FDMA}
  In a \emph{frequency division multiple access} (\emph{FDMA}) system, a certain frequency is assigned to a certain transmission channel between the sender and receiver.
\end{definition}

Some examples of this are:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Permanent: Radio broadcasting
\item Slow Hopping: GSM (2G)
\item Fast Hopping: FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{TDMA}\label{subsubsec:TDMA}
\begin{definition}[Time Division Multiple Access]\label{def:TDMA}
  A \emph{time division multiple access}  (\emph{TDMA}) system assigns a fixed sending frequency to a transmission channel \textbf{for a specific amount of time}.
\end{definition}


\subsubsection{CDMA}\label{subsubsec:CDMA}
