\section{Wireless Medium Access Control}\label{sec:Wireless_MAC}
We need to separate when devices are transmitting.
Due to the nature of radio waves, we cannot transmit simultaneously on the same frequency from multiple devices.

\subsection{Reservation Schemes}\label{subsec:Reservation_Scheme}
To begin our discussion of \nameref{def:Reservation_Scheme}s, we must talk about \nameref{def:ALOHA}.

\begin{definition}[ALOHA]\label{def:ALOHA}
  \emph{ALOHA} was one of the earliest protocols for wireless data transmission.
  It used a purely random access scheme, so when you had a packet to send, it was sent.
  To ensure devices knew if their transmission was successful, an acknoledgement was sent when the next recipient in the chain received the message.

  \begin{remark}
    It is only mentioned here because it is used as a baseline measurement for other protocols.
  \end{remark}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Reservation Scheme]\label{def:Reservation_Scheme}
  A \emph{reservation scheme} is the idea of reserving resources for a node in a wireless network to prevent collisions.
  The resources that can be reserved include: time, frequency, and others.

  We would like to reserve resources because the system will not lose capacity to collisions.
  But, if not \textbf{all} the resources are being fully utilized, then the system loses out on throughput.

  Because of the limitations of the radio spectrum and light being a broadcast medium, we have 4 main solutions for supporting multiple devices that was to transmit.
  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item \nameref{def:SDMA}
  \item \nameref{def:FDMA}
  \item \nameref{def:TDMA}
  \item \nameref{def:CDMA}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

    Disadvantages & Inflexible, antennas typically fixed. & Guard time needed (multipath propagation), synchronization difficult. & Inflexible, frequencies are a scarce resource and must be decided from beginning. & Complex receivers, needs more complicated power management from senders. \\ \midrule
    Comments & Only useful in combination with \nameref{subsubsec:TDMA}, \nameref{subsubsec:FDMA}, or \nameref{subsubsec:CDMA}. & Standard in fixed networks. Used together with \nameref{subsubsec:FDMA} and \nameref{subsubsec:SDMA} in mobile networks. & Typically combined with \nameref{subsubsec:TDMA} (frequency hopping patterns) and \nameref{subsubsec:SDMA} (frequency reuse) & Has some problems still. Higher complexity, lower expectations. Needs integration with \nameref{subsubsec:TDMA}/\nameref{subsubsec:FDMA}. \\

  \label{tab:DMA_Comparison}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{SDMA}\label{subsubsec:SDMA}
\begin{definition}[Space Division Multiple Access]\label{def:SDMA}
  In a \emph{space division multiple access} (\emph{SDMA}) setup, the space is segmented into sectors, then addressed with directed antennas.
  These tend to follow a distinct cell structure to handle varying number of people.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{FDMA}\label{subsubsec:FDMA}
\begin{definition}[Frequency Division Multiple Access]\label{def:FDMA}
  In a \emph{frequency division multiple access} (\emph{FDMA}) system, a certain frequency is assigned to a certain transmission channel between the sender and receiver.

  Because of the way FDMA works, it effectively acts like a \nameref{def:Circuit_Switching} system, so we can apply the same equations as \nameref{subsec:Model_Circuit_Switching}.
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:FDMA_Work_Rate}
    \eta = \frac{1}{n v} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} \rho_{i}
  \end{equation}
  where
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item $v$: The achievable rate, in bits/Hz/s. This includes:
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Guard bands
    \item Signaling Overheads
    \end{itemize}
  \item $N$: The number of nodes
  \item $\rho$: The utilized rate
  \item $\eta$: The rate of work
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Some examples of this are:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Permanent: Radio broadcasting
\item Slow Hopping: GSM (2G)
\item Fast Hopping: FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{OFDM}\label{par:OFDM}
\begin{definition}[Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing]\label{def:OFDM}
  \emph{Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing} or \emph{OFDM} is a way of breaking up the frequency spectrum into orthogonal frequencies into orthogonal subcarriers.
  An orthogonal subcarrier is a frequency that has a waveform that has a peak where all other subcarriers' waveform is zero.
  To achieve this, the equation below is used.
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Orthogonal_Subcarrier}
    \Delta f = \frac{k}{T_{U}}
  \end{equation}
  where
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item $k \in \NaturalNumbers$
  \item $T_{U}$ is the useful symbol duration
  \end{itemize}

  Because these subcarriers are orthogonal, there do not need to be guard bands between them, allowing for more efficient usage of the transmission spectrum.
  Also, each symbol is spread over a wider frequency range of many slowly-modulated narrowband signals instead of one rapidly-modulating wideband signal.
  If this is paired with error detection and correction, the transmission is even more robust.
\end{definition}

We can use \nameref{def:OFDM} to do 2 things:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item \nameref{par:Subcarrier_Allocation}
\item \nameref{par:Transmission_Power_Control}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Subcarrier Allocation}\label{par:Subcarrier_Allocation}
If a single node does not need the entire frequency spectrum that we have available, we can can share the channel's subcarrier frequencies between multiple nodes.
This flexibility means:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item We can assign different numbers of subcarriers to different nodes depending on the node's throughput requirements.
\item We can adjust which subcarriers are allocated to account for adverse channel conditions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{TDMA}\label{subsubsec:TDMA}
\begin{definition}[Time Division Multiple Access]\label{def:TDMA}
  A \emph{time division multiple access}  (\emph{TDMA}) system assigns a fixed sending frequency to a transmission channel \textbf{for a specific amount of time}.
\end{definition}


\subsubsection{CDMA}\label{subsubsec:CDMA}
\begin{definition}[Code Division Multiple Access]\label{def:CDMA}
   (\emph{CDMA})
\end{definition}
