\section{Wireless Medium Access Control}\label{sec:Wireless_MAC}
We need to separate when devices are transmitting.
Due to the nature of radio waves, we cannot transmit simultaneously on the same frequency from multiple devices.

\subsection{Energy-Efficient MACs}\label{subsec:Energy_Efficient_MACs}
In some systems, we need to make sure the power usage is minimized.
The biggest energy costs in a network are:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Sending Data
\item Receiving Data
\item Listening to the channel
\item Keeping the node's networking system on when it doesn't need to transmit or receive data.
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark*}
  The costs of both the transmission and reception of data are hard to minimize on a MAC level.
  These would usually be minimized by the design of hardware on the physical level and determining if it is worth it to send information at all in the application layer.
\end{remark*}

\begin{remark*}
  Collisions have a massive effect on the energy usage of a networking system.
  A collision means the receiver did not receive the packet correctly, so it must be retransmitted.
  Meaning, 2 transmissions and 2 receptions were needed to correctly read the packet, effectively double the correct amount of power.
\end{remark*}

\begin{remark*}
  \nameref{def:CSMA} is \textbf{not} a power-efficient MAC protocol, because it constantly listens to the channel.
  However, it can be improved by reducing the \nameref{def:Persistence} of the system.
\end{remark*}

\subsubsection{The LoRa Protocol}\label{subsubsec:LoRa_Protocol}
\begin{definition}[LoRa]\label{def:LoRa}
  \emph{LoRa} is a protocol suite designed for long range, low power communications.

  It uses a \nameref{def:Star_of_Stars} network topology.
  The end-point devices (usually \nameref{def:IoT} devices) generate the data.
  In between the end-point devices, there is the ``fog'' which is some amount of network gateways and managers.
  At the end ``star'' is the Cloud, where the appropriate company collects their data.
\end{definition}

In LoRa, there are 3 different MACs:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item Class A:\@ The baseline MAC
\item Class B:\@ The beacon MAC
\item Class C:\@ The continuous MAC
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Reception in the LoRa Protocol}\label{par:LoRa_Reception}
In a Class A LoRa system, the end device is \textbf{the only one} that can intiate tranmission.
After a transmission, the system goes back to sleep, becoming unreachable by the network.
There are 2 reception windows during which the end-point device can receive data.
If the unit receives its data during the first reception period, then it skips the second one.
