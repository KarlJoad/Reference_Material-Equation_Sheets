\section{Wireless Medium Access Control}\label{sec:Wireless_MAC}
We need to separate when devices are transmitting.
Due to the nature of radio waves, we cannot transmit simultaneously on the same frequency from multiple devices.

\subsection{Energy-Efficient MACs}\label{subsec:Energy_Efficient_MACs}
In some systems, we need to make sure the power usage is minimized.
The biggest energy costs in a network are:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Sending Data
\item Receiving Data
\item Listening to the channel
\item Keeping the node's networking system on when it doesn't need to transmit or receive data.
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark*}
  The costs of both the transmission and reception of data are hard to minimize on a MAC level.
  These would usually be minimized by the design of hardware on the physical level and determining if it is worth it to send information at all in the application layer.
\end{remark*}
