\section{Wireless Medium Access Control}\label{sec:Wireless_MAC}
We need to separate when devices are transmitting.
Due to the nature of radio waves, we cannot transmit simultaneously on the same frequency from multiple devices.

\subsection{Energy-Efficient MACs}\label{subsec:Energy_Efficient_MACs}
In some systems, we need to make sure the power usage is minimized.
The biggest energy costs in a network are:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Sending Data
\item Receiving Data
\item Listening to the channel
\item Keeping the node's networking system on when it doesn't need to transmit or receive data.
\end{itemize}
