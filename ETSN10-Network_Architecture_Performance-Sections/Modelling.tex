\section{Modelling}\label{sec:Modelling}
In our discussion of models, we have commonly referred to the OSI model for TCP/IP networking.
This is just one model, we have also used the queuing model to measure system performance.
But, just what is a model?
\begin{definition}[Model]\label{def:Model}
  A \emph{model} is a system that is constructed to have some certain similar properties to the system in reality.
  A model is a way to remove certain factors from the system, or limit them, so the overall system can be tested in a variety of ways.
