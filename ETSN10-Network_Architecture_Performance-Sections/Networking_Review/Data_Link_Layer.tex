\subsection{Data-Link Layer}\label{subsec:Data_Link_Layer}
\begin{definition}[Data-Link Layer]\label{def:Data_Link_Layer}
  The \emph{data-link layer} is the next layer in the \nameref{def:Networking_Stack}.
  All devices must implement this layer.
  The data-link layer is responsible for getting data between two devices that have a \nameref{def:Physical_Layer} connection between them.
  It is also known as the \emph{Medium Access Control (MAC) layer}.
  It controls when each device should use the link, and may also include error correction and retransmission.

  Some examples of these are:
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Ethernet
  \item Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
  \item 802.11 (WiFi)
  \item Bluetooth
  \end{itemize}
