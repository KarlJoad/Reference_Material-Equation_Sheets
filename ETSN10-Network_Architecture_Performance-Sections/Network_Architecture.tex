\section{Network Architecture}\label{sec:Network_Architecture}
\begin{definition}[Network Architecture]\label{def:Network_Architecture}
  \emph{Network Architecture} is:
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item How the overall system is designed: what components there are and how they interact.
  \item Protocols and technologies for all the layers of the network stack.
  \item Physical infrastructure: base stations, cables, antennas, routers, etc.
  \item How everything works together to meet the overall performance goals for the whole system.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Wireless vs. Wired Networks}\label{subsec:Wireless_vs_Wired}
Wireless and wired (fixed) networks operate under the same underlying network principles.
However, wireless systems have a very different set of challenges to also contend with, because of the nature of wireless radio communication, and it being a broadcast medium.

The biggest problems for wireless networks that wired networks do not have are:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Interference, \Cref{subsec:Wireless_Interference}
\item Mobility, \Cref{subsec:Wireless_Mobility}
\item Wireless channels:
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Path loss
  \item Shadowing
  \item Fading
  \item These will not be handled in this course.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
