\subsubsection{Congestion Control in TCP}\label{subsubsec:Congestion_Control_TCP}
In \nameref{def:Transmission_Control_Protocol}, there is a problem that occurs because of its greedy backoff procedure.

\begin{definition}[Global Synchronization Problem]\label{def:TCP_Global_Synchronization_Problem}
  \nameref{def:Transmission_Control_Protocol}'s \emph{global synchronization problem} occurs when a sudden burst of traffic causes simultaneous packet loss across many TCP sessions using a single (congested) link.
  Each of the affected TCP session backs off its send rate at the same time, causing link utilization to go way down.
