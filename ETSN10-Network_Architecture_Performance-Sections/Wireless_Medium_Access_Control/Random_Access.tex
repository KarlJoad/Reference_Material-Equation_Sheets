\begin{definition}[Random Access]\label{def:Random_Access}
  \emph{Random Access} is the process by which a user can request resources from a system for a duration of time.
  After this time period has passed, the resources are freed from that user an dmay be passed to another.

  This allows for sharing the same resources among many users, but htere may be contention for the resources.
  In addition, because there is not way to arbitrate the delivery of data, there may be packet collisions when multiple transmitters send data, and the receiver cannot decode the data from just one of them.
