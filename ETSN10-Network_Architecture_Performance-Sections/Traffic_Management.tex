\section{Traffic Management}\label{sec:Traffic_Management}
Up to this point, we have covered ways to provide and measure network performance of various layers.
But, isolated mechanisms at different layers in the network will not achieve much on their own.
All of these mechanisms must be coordinated into a single overall strategy for \emph{traffic management}.

\subsection{Steps for Effective Traffic Management}\label{subsec:Steps_Effective_Traffic_Management}
The steps for effective traffic management are below:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{Identify} applications' or flows' Quality of Service needs, and \textbf{categorize} the traffic accordingly.
\item \textbf{Enforce} traffic profiles to ensure the network has adequate resources to meet an applications' or flows' Quality of Service needs.
\item \textbf{Monitor} network performance to discover and respond to any problems that may occur.
\item \textbf{Provide} Quality of Service to meet the needs of each flow.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Identify and Categorize Traffic}\label{subsubsec:Identify_Categorize_Traffic}
Applications need a way to specify their Quality of Service needs and negotiate what kind of service they will receive from the network.
There are some specialized protocols, but they will not be covered in this course.

There are various ways to organize traffic into different classes that receive different Qualities of Service depending on the network's architecture and protocols.
