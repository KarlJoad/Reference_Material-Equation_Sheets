\section{Traffic Management}\label{sec:Traffic_Management}
Up to this point, we have covered ways to provide and measure network performance of various layers.
But, isolated mechanisms at different layers in the network will not achieve much on their own.
All of these mechanisms must be coordinated into a single overall strategy for \emph{traffic management}.

\subsection{Steps for Effective Traffic Management}\label{subsec:Steps_Effective_Traffic_Management}
The steps for effective traffic management are below:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{Identify} applications' or flows' Quality of Service needs, and \textbf{categorize} the traffic accordingly.
\item \textbf{Enforce} traffic profiles to ensure the network has adequate resources to meet an applications' or flows' Quality of Service needs.
\item \textbf{Monitor} network performance to discover and respond to any problems that may occur.
\item \textbf{Provide} Quality of Service to meet the needs of each flow.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Identify and Categorize Traffic}\label{subsubsec:Identify_Categorize_Traffic}
Applications need a way to specify their Quality of Service needs and negotiate what kind of service they will receive from the network.
There are some specialized protocols, but they will not be covered in this course.

There are various ways to organize traffic into different classes that receive different Qualities of Service depending on the network's architecture and protocols.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Access Classes in 802.11 EDCA
\item \nameref{def:Bearer}s in \nameref{def:LTE}
\item \nameref{def:Network_Slicing} in \nameref{def:5G}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Enforce Traffic Profiles}\label{subsubsec:Enforce_Traffic_Profiles}
For effective traffic management, the network needs a way to force traffic flows to comply with their agreed-upon traffic profiles, e.g.\ maximum data rate.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Admission Control: Do not allow flows into the network if there are not adequate resources available.
\item \nameref{def:Traffic_Shaping}: For example \nameref{def:Token_Bucket_Scheme}
\item \nameref{def:Flow_Control}: For example a \nameref{def:Credit_Based_Scheme}
\item Some \nameref{def:Queuing_Discipline}s ensure that a single flow cannot take more than its allowed share of bandwidth.
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item \nameref{def:Bit_Round_Fair_Queuing}
  \item \nameref{def:Weighted_Fair_Queuing}
  \item \nameref{def:Class_Based_Queuing}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Monitor Network Performance}\label{subsubsec:Monitor_Network_Performance}
To provide good performance, we have to be able to measure the actual performance currently achieved.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \nameref{def:Congestion_Control} signalling.
\item Monitoring protocols (e.g. Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)).
\item Signalling between routers and controller in \nameref{def:Software_Defined_Networking}.
\item Manual monitoring and response by network operators.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Provide Quality of Service}\label{subsubsec:Provide_QoS}
There are many different methods for providing different types of QoS to traffic flows.
Some that are covered in this course include:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \nameref{def:Queuing_Discipline}s
\item Resource allocation and prioritisation in MAC protocols
\item 802.11 EDCA
\item Radio Access Network resource allocation in cellular networks
\item Reservation schemes
\item Random Early Discard (RED)
\item TCP congestion control
\end{itemize}
