\section{\texttt{man} Pages}\label{sec:Man_Pages}
The \texttt{man} pages, standing for manual pages, are reference documents for using these APIs.
If you are curious about a function, you can just type \texttt{man func-name}.

These will give detailed information about the function, and possibly other, related, functions.

There are several sections of \texttt{man} pages, listed below:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item General Commands
\item System Calls
\item Library functions, in particular the C standard library
\item Special files (usually devices, those found in /dev) and drivers
\item File formats and conventions
\item Games and screensavers
\item Miscellanea
\item System administration commands and daemons
\end{enumerate}
