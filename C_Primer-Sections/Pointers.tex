\section{Pointers}\label{sec:Pointers}
This should technically go in \Cref{sec:Syntax}, but pointers deserve their own section.

\begin{definition}[Pointer]\label{def:Pointer}
A \emph{pointer} is a variable declared to store a memory address.
With this memory address, we can refer to data in-memory.
The size of the pointer is determined by the architecture of the CPU.\@
\end{definition}

A pointer is designated by its \textbf{DECLARED} type, \textbf{NOT} its contents.
This allows the data the pointer points to to be re-interpreted based on the declared type of the pointer.
This is shown in \Cref{lst:Pointers_Reinterpret_Data}.
