\section{Pointers}\label{sec:Pointers}
This should technically go in \Cref{sec:Syntax}, but pointers deserve their own section.

\begin{definition}[Pointer]\label{def:Pointer}
A \emph{pointer} is a variable declared to store a memory address.
With this memory address, we can refer to data in-memory.
The size of the pointer is determined by the architecture of the CPU.\@
