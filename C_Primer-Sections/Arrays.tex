\section{Arrays}\label{sec:Arrays}
An \nameref{def:Array} is the only way to store multiple items under a single name.

\begin{definition}[Array]\label{def:Array}
  A \emph{array} is a contiguous block of memory.
  Arrays are indexed items, meaning they use a number to identify each item.
\end{definition}

\nameref{def:Array}s are declared with the following syntax \cinline{type arr_name[size]}.
This declaration also implicitly allocates space for its storage.
This allocates the space from the function \textbf{stack} \textit{NOT} the heap.

There is \textbf{NO} metadata about the array, such as its length.
This means:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{NO} implicit size
\item \textbf{NO} bounds checking
\end{itemize}
