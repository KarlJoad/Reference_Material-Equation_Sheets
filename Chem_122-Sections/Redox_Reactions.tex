\section{Reduction-Oxidation Reactions} \label{sec:Redox Reactions}
These reactions are somewhat unique because the electrons \emph{ONLY} move around but do not change the output of the reaction.

\begin{definition}[Reduction-Oxidation Reactions] \label{def:Redox Reactions}
  \emph{Reduction-Oxidation Reactions} or \emph{Redox Reactions} are a type of chemical reaction.
  These reactions take place due to differences in electronegativity and \nameref{def:Oxidation States}.
