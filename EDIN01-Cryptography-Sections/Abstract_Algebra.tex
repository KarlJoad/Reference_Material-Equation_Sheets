\section{Abstract Algebra}\label{sec:Abstract_Algebra}
In the beginning of this course, we covered some basic abstract algebra.
These include:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Aspects covering integers and calculus modulo $n$
\item Covering a few examples of algebraic structures
\item Some basic concepts from abstract algebra, which provide a more general treatement of algebraic structures
\item In cryptography, we are generally interested in \emph{finite} sets
\end{itemize}
