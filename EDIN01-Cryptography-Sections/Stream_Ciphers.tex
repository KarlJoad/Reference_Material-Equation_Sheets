\section{Stream Ciphers --- LFSR Sequences}\label{sec:Stream_Ciphers}
There are 2 main types of \nameref{def:Symmetric_Encryption} algorithms:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item \nameref{def:Block_Cipher}s
\item \nameref{def:Stream_Cipher}s
\end{enumerate}

\begin{definition}[Stream Cipher]\label{def:Stream_Cipher}
  \emph{Stream cipher}s encrypt individual characters of the \nameref{def:Plaintext} using an encryption transofrmation that varies with time.
  The 2 elements that make up a stream cipher are \textbf{memory} and a \textbf{combinatorial function}.
  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item Memory
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \nameref{def:LFSR}s
    \item Tables (Arrays)
    \end{itemize}
  \item Combinatorial Function
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Nonlinear Boolean functions, S-boxes
    \item XOR, Modular addition, cyclic rotations, multiplication
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Keystream]\label{def:Keystream}
  The \emph{keystream} is the output of the generator, which gets used on the \nameref{def:Plaintext} message to form the \nameref{def:Ciphertext}
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Keystream}
    \mathbf{z} = z_{1}, z_{2}, \ldots
  \end{equation}

  \begin{remark}[Attacks]\label{rmk:Keystream_Attack_Vectors}
    For a synchronous \nameref{def:Stream_Cipher}, a \nameref{def:Attack-Known_Plaintext}, \nameref{def:Attack-Chosen_Plaintext}, or \nameref{def:Attack-Chosen_Ciphertext} is equivalent to having access to the \nameref{def:Keystream}.
  \end{remark}

  \begin{remark}[Secret Key]\label{rmk:Keystream_Secret_Key}
    When the \nameref{def:Keystream} first starts, because it is a synchronous system, it needs to have a starting value with which to generate subsequent values.
    This first value may be fixed, and is the secret key, $K$, in this case.
  \end{remark}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Assumptions}\label{subsec:Stream_Cipher_Assumptions}
We assume that
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item The output \nameref{def:Keystream} of length $N$ is known to Eve.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Attacks}\label{subsec:Stream_Cipher_Attacks}
An attack is considered successful only if the complexity of performing it is considerably lower than the exhaustive keysearch of complexity $2^{k}$.

The attack types that are of interest are:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \emph{\nameref{def:Attack-Key_Recovery}}: Eve tries to recover the \nameref{rmk:Keystream_Secret_Key}, $K$.
\item \emph{\nameref{def:Attack-Distinguishing}}: Eve tries to determine whether a given sequence $\hat{\mathbf{z}} = z_{1}, z_{2}, \ldots, z_{N}$ is likely to have been generated from the considered \nameref{def:Stream_Cipher}, or if it's a truly random sequence.
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}[Key Recovery Attack]\label{def:Attack-Key_Recovery}
  In a \emph{key recovery attack}, Eve tries to recover the \nameref{rmk:Keystream_Secret_Key}, $K$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Distinguishing Attack]\label{def:Attack-Distinguishing}
  In a \emph{distinguishing attack}, Eve tries to determine whether a given sequence $\hat{\mathbf{z}} = z_{1}, z_{2}, \ldots, z_{N}$ is likely to have been generated from the considered \nameref{def:Stream_Cipher}, or if it's a truly random sequence.

  Let $D(\mathbf{z})$ be an algorithm that takes in a sequence $\mathbf{z}$ of length $N$, and outputs either ``X'' or ``RANDOM''.
  With probability $\frac{1}{2}$, the sequence $\mathbf{z}$ is produced by a generator $X$ otherwise, it is a random sequence.
  The probability that $D(\mathbf{z})$ correctly determines the origin of $\mathbf{z}$ is written $\Prob \bigl( D(\mathbf{z}) \bigr) = \frac{1}{2} + \epsilon$.
  If $\epsilon$ is not very close to zero, then $D(\mathbf{z})$ is a \emph{distinguisher} for the generator $X$, because it can more often than not distinguish that the sequence is nonrandom.

  \begin{remark}
    A \nameref{def:Attack-Distinguishing} is a much weaker attack than a \nameref{def:Attack-Key_Recovery}.
  \end{remark}
