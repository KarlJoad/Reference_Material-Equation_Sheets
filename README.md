# EquationSheets
This repository holds the \LaTeX equation sheets that Karl Hallsby made for his classes at IIT.
To use this repository, you must `git clone` this repository to a directory.

# TEMPLATE.tex
This is a template document that all subsequent documents will be based off of.
This ensures that the packages that are in each document are the same, and that they will have a similar formatting to them.

# Separate Sections
For most of these, there will be an extra folder named `./Course_Num-Sections`. This is where the extra LaTeX files are stored and pulled from.

# Drawings
Any images/drawings will be placed in `./Drawings/`. Each class has its own subdirectory, therefore there might be cross-over in the pictures that are present in each folder. This is intentional. 

# Output
All documents are output to `./TeX_Output`. The PDFs are named the same as their LaTeX counterparts.
