# EquationSheets
This repository holds the LaTeX equation sheets that Karl Hallsby made for his classes.
These courses are both from IIT and from Lund University's LTH (Lunds Tekniska HÃ¶gskola).
To use this repository, you must `git clone` this repository to a directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: You could also download this repository as a `.zip` folder, and unzip it yourself.
However, you will not get the most up-to-date documents all the time.

# TEMPLATE.tex
This is a template document that all subsequent documents will be based off of.
This ensures that the packages that are in each document are the same, and that they will have a similar formatting to them.

# Separate Sections
For most of these, there will be an extra folder named `./Course_Num-Sections`.
This is where the extra LaTeX files are stored and pulled from.

## New Course Folder Naming Scheme (Fall 2019)
Starting in Fall 2019, I changed the way I named these extra folders.
They are now `./Course_Num-Short_Course_Name-Sections`.

# Drawings
Any images/drawings will be placed in `./Drawings/`.
Each class has its own subdirectory, therefore there might be cross-over in the pictures that are present in each folder.
This is intentional.

# PDF Output
All documents are output to `./TeX_Output`.
The PDFs are named the same as their LaTeX counterparts.
**You can download the PDFs individually!!**

These PDFs will have hyperlinks in them, which will allow you to click through the document to jump somewhere quickly.
*The hyperlinks may show up as colored boxes.*
  * The **red** boxes are hyperlinks to jump through the documents
  * The **blue** boxes are hyperlinks to websites/web locations
  * The **green** boxes are citation hyperlinks to the bibliography (if one is present)
