\subsection{Sockets}\label{subsec:Sockets}
In general, networking is done with message-oriented communication.
This is typically done with packets, which is a byte oriented \textbf{stream} of data.
Packets are used because of:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Persistent
\item Synchronicity
\item These packets are routed through potentially multiple computers before reaching a destination
\item You buffer the packets you receive to handle the data as it comes.
\end{itemize}
