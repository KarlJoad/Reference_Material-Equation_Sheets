\subsection{Sockets}\label{subsec:Sockets}
In general, networking is done with message-oriented communication.
This is typically done with packets, which is a byte oriented \textbf{stream} of data.
Packets are used because of:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Persistent
\item Synchronicity
\item These packets are routed through potentially multiple computers before reaching a destination
\item You buffer the packets you receive to handle the data as it comes.
\end{itemize}

Sockets are \textbf{not} limited to just inter-computer network communication.
They can also be used within the same computer.
For example:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Emacs (Emacs server + \texttt{emacsclient}) is written to be usable over a socket on the local computer
\item Remote communication happens for email, web browsing, etc.
\end{itemize}
