\subsection{Remote Procedure Calls}\label{subsec:RPC}
The question here is: How do we make ``distributed computing look like traditional computing''?
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item The standard Client-Server protocol provides usable mechanisms for services in distributed systems
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item But, these require explicit communication, and require an explicit Send-Receive Paradigm.
  \end{itemize}
\item Can we use procedure calls to do this?
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item The goal here is to make a remote procedure call look like a local procedure call.
  \end{itemize}
\item In distributed system, the callee may be a completely different system from the one executing.
\end{itemize}
