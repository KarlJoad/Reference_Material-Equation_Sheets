\subsection{Terminating Processes, \texttt{exit}}\label{subsec:Terminating_Processes-exit}
There are several possible ways for a \nameref{def:Process} to terminate.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item The simplest way to terminate a \nameref{def:Process} is for the main process to \texttt{return}.
  If we are being pedantic, the compiler actually implicitly inserts an \texttt{exit} in this case, making all possible exits from a process use \texttt{exit}.

\item The \texttt{exit} \nameref{def:Syscall}.
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item This exits immediately
  \item This may prevent a normal \texttt{return}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
