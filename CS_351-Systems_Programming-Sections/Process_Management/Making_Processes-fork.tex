\subsection{Making Processes, \texttt{fork}}\label{subsec:Making_Processes-fork}
\texttt{fork} creates a \textbf{copy} of the current \nameref{def:Process}.
This is our \textit{only} method of creating new processes.
The child process is nearly an \textbf{exact} duplicate of the parent process, where only some process metadata in the \nameref{def:Process_Control_Block} is different.
The function prototype for \cinline{fork} is shown in \Cref{lst:PID_Definition_fork_Declaration}.
