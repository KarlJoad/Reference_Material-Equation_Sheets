\section{Input/Output (I/O)}\label{sec:IO}
In \textsc{unix}, I/O devices include:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Disk
\item Terminal
\item Shared Memory
\item Printer
\item Network
\end{itemize}

This is mostly because \textsc{unix} made the design decision to try to view every component of a system as a \nameref{def:File}.
