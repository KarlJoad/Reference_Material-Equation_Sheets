\section{Processes}\label{sec:Processes}
\nameref{def:Process}es are the fundamental unit of computation within an operating system.
\begin{definition}[Process]\label{def:Process}
  A \emph{process} is a \nameref{def:Program} in execution.
  A process carries out the computation that we specify.
  A process contains:
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Code (\texttt{text}) of your program.
  \item Runtime data (Global, local, dynamic variables)
  \item \nameref{def:Register}s:
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \nameref{def:Program_Counter} (\texttt{PC})
    \item \nameref{def:Stack_Pointer} (\texttt{SP})
    \item \nameref{def:Frame_Pointer} (\texttt{FP})
    \end{itemize}
  \item \nameref{def:Process_Control_Block}
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Program]\label{def:Program}
  A \emph{program} is the binary image stored at some file location on the storage medium.
  The program is read into memory, and then is used to start a \nameref{def:Process} that runs that program.
\end{definition}

\nameref{def:Process}es require both a \textbf{predictable} and \textbf{logical} control flow.
This means:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item The \nameref{def:Process} must start somewhere, typically defined to be \texttt{main}.
\item Nothing can disrupt a program mid-execution.
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item This is further discussed in \Cref{subsec:Prevent_Process_Disruption}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prevent Process Disruption}\label{subsec:Prevent_Process_Disruption}
The easiest way to prevent a \nameref{def:Process} from having its control flow being interrupted is for the process to ``own'' the CPU for the entire duration of the process's execution.
However, this means:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item No other process can run on this core
\item This prevents efficient multi-\nameref{def:Process}/multitasking systems
\item Malicious or poorly written program can ``take over'' the CPU
\item An idle process (for example, waiting for user input) will underutilize the CPU
\end{itemize}

For the operating system to simulate this seamless logical control flow, we use all of the information used to make a \nameref{def:Process}, and need a \nameref{def:Process_Control_Block}.
\begin{definition}[Process Control Block]\label{def:Process_Control_Block}
  The \emph{Process Control Block} (\emph{PCB}) contains additional metadata about a \nameref{def:Process}.
  This includes:
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Process ID (\texttt{PID})
  \item CPU Usage
  \item Memory Usage
  \item Pending \nameref{def:Syscall}s
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The \nameref{def:Process_Control_Block} is sued to allow \nameref{def:Process}es to be interrupted, saved, and moved off a core.
This allows the operating system to schedule processes according to some algorithm.

\begin{definition}[Syscall]\label{def:Syscall}
  A \emph{syscall}, short for a \emph{system call} is a way for a user-level \nameref{def:Process} to perform some computation that the operating system kernel restricts.
  Some common syscalls are:
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Opening a file
  \item Reading a file
  \item Writing a file
  \item Closing a file
  \item Creating a process
  \item Changing the process's binary
  \item Reading from the network
  \item Writing to the network
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Required Hardware}\label{subsec:Required_Hardware}
Interrupting the execution of a \nameref{def:Process} requires some hardware support to be possible and efficient.
We need 3 things:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item A hardware mechanism to periodically interrupt the current \nameref{def:Process} to change execution to the operating system.
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item This is usually the \emph{periodic clock interrupt}.
  \end{itemize}
\item An operating system procedure to decide which processes to run, and in which order.
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item This is the operating system's \nameref{def:Process_Scheduler}.
  \end{itemize}
\item A routine for seamlessly switching between processes.
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item This is called a \nameref{def:Context_Switch}.
  \item Relatively speaking, these are expensive to perform.
  \item \textbf{These are external to a \nameref{def:Process}'s logical control flow}.
  \item This forms part of the process of \nameref{def:Exceptional_Control_Flow}.
  \item A \nameref{def:Context_Switch} makes no guarantee about if and/or when this \nameref{def:Process} will start running again.
  \item A \nameref{def:Context_Switch} is the only way to invoke \nameref{def:Syscall}s.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

To schedule \nameref{def:Process}es onto one of possibly many CPUs, there are programs called \nameref{def:Process_Scheduler}s.

Every time the \nameref{def:Process_Scheduler} schedules a new \nameref{def:Process}, or when a process needs to perform a \nameref{def:Syscall}, or a kernel-level exception occurs, a \nameref{def:Context_Switch} is made.
\begin{definition}[Context Switch]\label{def:Context_Switch}
  A \emph{context switch} is the process of interrupting a \nameref{def:Process}, saving its current state, and scheduling something else to run on that CPU.\@
  This is done whenever a \nameref{def:Syscall} is made, and happens sometimes during a process's lifetime.
\end{definition}

\nameref{def:Context_Switch}es form a core part of the \nameref{def:Exceptional_Control_Flow}.

\subsection{Process Scheduling}\label{subsec:Process_Scheduling}
Process scheduling is the process by which a process is put ``scheduled'' onto a particular CPU, according to some criteria.
There are any number of scheduling algorithms, each of which optimizes for certain cases, and may yield a different order of process execution.
\begin{definition}[Process Scheduler]\label{def:Process_Scheduler}
  The \emph{process scheduler} is an operating system component that chooses which \nameref{def:Process} to run next.
  It chooses this according to some algorithm, each of which might change the order of process execution.
\end{definition}

One such \nameref{def:Process_Scheduler} is the \nameref{subsubsec:Priority_Scheduling} algorithm.
