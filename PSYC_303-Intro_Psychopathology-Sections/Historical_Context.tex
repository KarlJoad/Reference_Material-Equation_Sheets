\begin{definition}[Psychological Disfunction]\label{def:Psychological_Disfunction}
  \emph{Psychological dysfunction} refers to a breakdown in cognitive, emotional, or behavioral functioning.
  For example, if you are out on a date, it should be fun.
  But if you experience severe fear all evening and just want to go home, even though there is nothing to be afraid of, and the severe fear happens on every date, your emotions are not functioning properly.
