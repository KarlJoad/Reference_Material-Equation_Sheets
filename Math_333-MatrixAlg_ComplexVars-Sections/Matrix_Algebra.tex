\begin{definition}[Matrix]\label{def:Matrix}
  A \emph{matrix} is an array of numbers subject to special addition and multiplication rules.
  They are represented with capital letters, $A$, $B$, etc.
  However, other texts may bold those capital letters to, $\mathbf{A}$, $\mathbf{B}$, etc.
  When written, they can be written in one of two ways, but they both mean the same thing.
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Matrix}
    \begin{aligned}
      &\begin{pmatrix}
        a_{11} & a_{12} \\
        a_{21} & a_{22} \\
      \end{pmatrix} \\
      &\begin{bmatrix}
        a_{11} & a_{12} \\
        a_{21} & a_{22} \\
      \end{bmatrix}
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}

Matrices are very useful, as learning the intricacies of them allows for quick solving of larger problems.
