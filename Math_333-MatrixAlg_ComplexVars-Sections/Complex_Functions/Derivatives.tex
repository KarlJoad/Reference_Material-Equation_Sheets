\subsection{Derivatives}\label{subsec:Derivatives}
\begin{definition}[Derivative]\label{def:Complex_Derivative}
  The \emph{derivative} of a \nameref{def:Complex_Function}, like many other operations, must have its definitions slightly redefined to account for the extra dimension provided by the \nameref{def:Argand_Plane}.

  The \textbf{domain} of a derivative of a \nameref{def:Complex_Function} $f(z)$ requires that $f$ be defined in a \nameref{def:Neighborhood} of the point $a$.
  Once this is satisified, then \Cref{eq:Complex_Derivative} is used to find the actual value.
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Complex_Derivative}
    f'(a) = \lim\limits_{z \to a} \frac{f(z) - f(a)}{z - a}
  \end{equation}

  \begin{remark}[Path Existence]\label{rmk:Complex_Derivative_Path_Existence}
    Because the \nameref{def:Complex_Derivative} of a \nameref{def:Complex_Function} is defined with a \nameref{def:Complex_Limit}, \textbf{ALL} paths must exist and have the same value.
  \end{remark}

  \begin{remark}[Uses]\label{rmk:Complex_Derivative_Uses}
    The definition of a \nameref{def:Complex_Derivative} is rarely used to calculate anything.
    Instead, it is used to prove the non-existence of a derivative of a complex function.
  \end{remark}
