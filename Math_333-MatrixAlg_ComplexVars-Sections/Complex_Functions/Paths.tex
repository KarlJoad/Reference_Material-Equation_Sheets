\subsection{Paths}\label{subsec:Paths}
In this course, \nameref{def:Path}s, curve, and contour are synonymous.
However, in general, they are not.

\begin{definition}[Path]\label{def:Path}
  A \emph{path} is static \nameref{def:Image} of a line on a plane.
  However, when we say we are interested in the path of an image, we are not really talking about the static image we see, but rather \textbf{HOW} we got that image, what function generated it, etc.
