\subsection{Limits}\label{subsec:Limits}
Like in earlier maths, sometimes we are interested not in the exact point where a function has a value; instead, we are interested in how the function behaves as we approach that point.
If the function is a \nameref{def:Complex_Function}, i.e.\ ($\ComplexNumbers \mapsto \ComplexNumbers$), then we need to change our definition of a limit from the one we are familiar with to the one in \Cref{def:Complex_Limit}.

\begin{definition}[Limit]\label{def:Complex_Limit}
  The \emph{limit} of a \nameref{def:Complex_Function} behaves quite similarly to their purely-real counterparts.
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Complex_Limit}
    \lim\limits_{\substack{z \to a \\ z \neq a}} f(z) = \ell
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
