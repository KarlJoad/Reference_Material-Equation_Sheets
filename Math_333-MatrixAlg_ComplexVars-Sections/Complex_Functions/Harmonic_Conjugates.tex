\subsection{Harmonic Conjugates}\label{subsec:Harmonic_Conjugates}
Now that we have shown and proven that a function can be \nameref{def:Harmonic} in \Cref{ex:Prove Function Terms are Harmonic}, we are curious to see that if one function is known, can we find the other one.

\begin{definition}[Simply]\label{def:Simply}
  A \emph{simply} \nameref{def:Connected} set is a connected set $\Omega$ that does not have any holes in it.

  \begin{remark}[Multiply-Connected]\label{rmk:Multiply_Connected}
    If there is one hole, the region is \emph{doubly}-connected. \\
    If there are two holes, the region is \emph{triply}-connected.
  \end{remark}
\end{definition}
