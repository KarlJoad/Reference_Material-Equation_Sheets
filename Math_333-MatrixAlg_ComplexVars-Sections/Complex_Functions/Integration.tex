\subsection{Integration}\label{subsec:Integration}
The integration method that we will present in this section is \nameref{def:Path}-agnostic.
This means that regardless of how you go about \nameref{def:Parameterizing_Path} the \nameref{def:Path}, the integral returns the same result.

The functions we will be integrating are complex-valued functions.
We will be integrating these functions along one of their many \nameref{def:Path}s.
These paths are typically denoted with either $C$, $\Gamma$, or $\gamma$.
I will choose $\Path$ in this document, to match up with the use of $\Path$ in \nameref{def:Complex_Limit}s.
