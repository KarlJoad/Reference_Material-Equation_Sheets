\subsubsection{Integration on Paths}\label{subsubsec:Integration_on_Paths}
The integration method that we will present in this section is \nameref{def:Path}-agnostic.
This means that regardless of how you go about \nameref{def:Parameterizing_Path} the \nameref{def:Path}, the integral returns the same result.

The functions we will be integrating are complex-valued functions.
We will be integrating these functions along one of their many \nameref{def:Path}s.
These paths are typically denoted with either $C$, $\Gamma$, or $\gamma$.
I will choose $\Path$ in this document, to match up with the use of $\Path$ in \nameref{def:Complex_Limit}s.

\begin{definition}[Integration on Paths]\label{def:Integration_on_Paths}
  Let $f$ be a continuous function on the image of the \nameref{def:Path}.
  We denote this integral similarly to how we denote it regularly.
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Integration_on_Paths}
    \begin{aligned}
      \int_{\Path} f &= \int_{\Path} f(z) dz \\
      &\coloneqq \int_{a}^{b} f\bigl( z(t) \bigr) z'(t) dt
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}

  \begin{remark}
    You can \textbf{always} perform an integration by parameterizing the path and integrating.
    However, this can become very complex sometimes.
  \end{remark}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Lecture 7]{Calculate the Integral on any Path}
  Given the line segment $\ell = [-4+5i, 3-2i]$, and an arbitrary point $z$ defined by the function $z(t)$.
  Evaluate $\int_{\ell} \Real{z} dz$?
  \tcblower{}
  Start by parameterizing the path.
  I will use the general form of finding a parameterized function for $z(t)$ from \Cref{eq:Parameterizing_Path}.
  \begin{align*}
    z(t) &= a(1-t) + bt \:\: 0 \leq t \leq 1 \\
         &= (-4+5i)(1-t) + (3-2i)t \:\: 0 \leq t \leq 1
  \end{align*}

  Now, we can evaluate the integral.
  \begin{align*}
    \int_{\ell} \Real{z} dz &= \int_{0}^{1} \bigl( -4(1-t) + 3t \bigr) z'(t) dt \\
                            &= \int_{0}^{1} (7t - 4) z'(t) dt \\
                            &= \int_{0}^{1} (7t - 4) \bigl( (-4+5i)(-t) + (3-2i) \bigr) dt \\
                            &= \int_{0}^{1} (7t - 4) (7 - 7i) dt \\
                            &= (7-7i) \int_{0}^{1} (7t-4) dt \\
                            &= (7-7i) \left( {\left[ \frac{7}{2}t^{2}-4t \right]}_{t=0}^{t=1} \right) \\
                            &= \frac{-7}{2}(1-i)
  \end{align*}
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Antiderivatives}\label{subsubsec:Antiderivatives}
\begin{theorem}[Complex Antiderivative]\label{thm:Complex_Antiderivative}
  Let $\Omega$ be a \nameref{def:Simply_Connected}, \nameref{def:Connected}, and \nameref{def:Open} region.
  Let $f$ be an \nameref{def:Analytic} \nameref{def:Complex_Function} defined on $\Omega$, $f: \Omega \to \ComplexNumbers$ on $\Omega$.

  Then, there exists another \nameref{def:Analytic} function ($\exists F: \Omega \to \ComplexNumbers$) such that the derivative of the new function is equal to the original function.
  \begin{equation*}
    F' = f
  \end{equation*}

  Thus, $F$ is \textbf{an} antiderivatives of $f$.
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Complex_Antiderivative}
    \int_{\Path} f = F(B) - F(A)
  \end{equation}

  \begin{remark*}[Use]
    This is mainly used for evaluating integrals.
  \end{remark*}
\end{theorem}

If we look at \Cref{eq:Complex_Antiderivative}, we notice that the right-hand side ($F(B) - F(A)$) is independent of the \nameref{def:Path}.

\begin{example}[Lecture 7]{Antiderivatives}
  Evaluate the integral $\int_{\Path} z \sin \left( z^{2} \right) dz$ where $\Path$ is equal to the union of the line segment that stretches from the origin to $(1, 2)$, \textbf{with} the lower half of the circle whose center is at $a = 3+2i$ with radius $r = 2$.
  \tcblower{}
  Using \Cref{thm:Complex_Antiderivative}, we know that we don't have to actually evaluate this integral.
  Instead, we can find the beginning and end points of the \nameref{def:Path}, and just take the difference of those.
  So, $A = 0+0i$, and $B = 5+2i$.
  $z \sin \left( z^{2} \right)$ is \nameref{def:Analytic} on $\ComplexNumbers$.
  Therefore, we are guaranteed the derivative's existence.
  This also means that \textbf{an} antiderivative exists.
  \begin{equation*}
    F(z) = \frac{-1}{2} \cos \left( z^{2} \right)
  \end{equation*}

  Remember that there would be a constant term at the end of the antiderivative, but because we will be using this function and subtracting it from another value, the constants would just cancel each other out.

  Using \Cref{eq:Complex_Antiderivative}, we can now solve this directly.
  \begin{align*}
    \int_{\Path} f &= \int_{\Path} z \sin \left( z^{2} \right) dz \\
                   &= F(B) - F(A) \\
                   &= \frac{-1}{2} \cos \left( {(5+2i)}^{2} \right) - \frac{-1}{2} \cos \left( {(0+0i)}^{2} \right) \\
                   &= \frac{-1}{2} \left( \cos \left( {(5+2i)}^{2} \right) - \cos(0) \right) \\
                   &= \frac{-1}{2} \left( \cos \left( {(5+2i)}^{2} \right) \right) + \frac{1}{2} \\
  \end{align*}

  The last step would be to use the \nameref{subsec:Angle Sum and Difference Identities} to simplify the remaining $\cos$ into a normal, Cartesian, form.
