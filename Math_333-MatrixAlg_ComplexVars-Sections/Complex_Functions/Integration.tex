\subsection{Integration}\label{subsec:Integration}
The integration method that we will present in this section is \nameref{def:Path}-agnostic.
This means that regardless of how you go about \nameref{def:Parameterizing_Path} the \nameref{def:Path}, the integral returns the same result.

The functions we will be integrating are complex-valued functions.
We will be integrating these functions along one of their many \nameref{def:Path}s.
These paths are typically denoted with either $C$, $\Gamma$, or $\gamma$.
I will choose $\Path$ in this document, to match up with the use of $\Path$ in \nameref{def:Complex_Limit}s.

\begin{definition}[Integration on Paths]\label{def:Integration_on_Paths}
  Let $f$ be a continuous function on the image of the \nameref{def:Path}.
  We denote this integral similarly to how we denote it regularly.
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Integration_on_Paths}
    \begin{aligned}
      \int_{\Path} f &= \int_{\Path} f(z) dz \\
      &= \int_{a}^{b} f\bigl( z(t) \bigr) z'(t) dt
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
